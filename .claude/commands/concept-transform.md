# Concept Transformation Protocol

Ultrathink through the transformation of scattered brainstorming ideas into a structured, production-ready product concept.

## Input Processing

Take the provided brainstorming notes, scattered ideas, or rough concepts and apply rigorous analysis to extract value.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Core Problem Extraction
**Think hard about:**
- What fundamental pain point is being addressed?
- Who specifically experiences this problem?
- What's the real-world impact of not solving it?
- How do people currently handle this problem?

### 2. Solution Synthesis
**Identify and organize:**
- Key technological approaches mentioned
- Feasible vs aspirational features
- Core value propositions
- Differentiation opportunities

### 3. Market Reality Check
**Validate through research:**
- Target market size and characteristics
- Existing competitive solutions
- User personas and their specific needs
- Market timing and trend alignment

### 4. Technical Feasibility Assessment
**Evaluate implementation viability:**
- Required technology stack
- Development complexity and timeline
- Scalability considerations
- Integration requirements

## Validation Questions

Before finalizing the concept, answer:

1. **Problem Validation:** Can you find evidence this problem exists at scale?
2. **Solution Validation:** Do the proposed features actually solve the core problem?
3. **Market Validation:** Is there a viable path to reach target customers?
4. **Technical Validation:** Can this be built with current technology?
5. **Business Validation:** Is there a sustainable revenue model?

## Refinement Process

### Eliminate Contradictions
- Remove conflicting ideas
- Consolidate overlapping concepts
- Prioritize highest-impact features

### Focus on Market Potential
- Emphasize features with strongest market pull
- Remove nice-to-have vs must-have features
- Ensure technical feasibility

### Create Clear Narrative
- Consistent user experience story
- Logical feature progression
- Clear value demonstration

## Memory Documentation

Update `.claude/memory/decisions.md` with:
- Concept transformation rationale
- Key assumptions made
- Features eliminated and why
- Market insights discovered

Remember: A concept without clear market need and technical feasibility is just an idea.
