## Role Switch Execution

### Pre-Switch Checklist
```bash
# Before switching roles, ensure:

1. SAVE CURRENT STATE
   - Update current task status
   - Document progress and decisions  
   - Note any blockers or issues
   - Create handoff tasks if needed

2. COMPLETE COORDINATION
   - Finish current coordination points
   - Update integration contracts
   - Notify dependent roles of changes
   - Document decisions in appropriate files

3. PREPARE CONTEXT
   - Review target role's pending tasks
   - Check for priority items
   - Gather required context materials
   - Set up working environment
```

### Switch Execution Protocol
```bash
# 1. Save Current Session State
echo "## Session End: $(date)" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md
echo "**Role:** [CURRENT_ROLE]" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md
echo "**Completed:** [TASK_SUMMARY]" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md
echo "**Handoffs:** [PENDING_TASKS]" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md
echo "" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md

# 2. Load Target Role Context
echo "## Session Start: $(date)" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md
echo "**Role:** [TARGET_ROLE]" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md
echo "**Priority Tasks:** [TASK_LIST]" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md
echo "**Context:** [DIRECTORY]" >> .claude/memory/session-state.md

# 3. Apply Role Configuration
# - Load system prompt override
# - Set working directory
# - Apply tool constraints
# - Review role-specific files

# 4. Begin Role Execution
# - Review pending tasks for this role
# - Check integration requirements
# - Start with highest priority work
```

## Role Coordination Patterns

### Architectural Review Pattern
```bash
# When any role needs architectural guidance:

1. CURRENT_ROLE -> ARCHITECT
   Task Type: REVIEW
   Context: Technical decision needed
   Expected: Architectural guidance

2. ARCHITECT reviews and decides
   Updates architecture decisions
   Provides guidance back to role

3. ARCHITECT -> CURRENT_ROLE  
   Task Type: IMPLEMENTATION
   Context: Approved approach
   Expected: Implementation following guidance
```

### Cross-Domain Collaboration Pattern
```bash
# When roles need to work together:

1. FRONTEND -> BACKEND (via Architect)
   Issue: API response format needs change
   
2. ARCHITECT coordinates discussion
   Creates shared workspace for alignment
   
3. BACKEND + FRONTEND -> ARCHITECT
   Propose solution that works for both
   
4. ARCHITECT approves and updates contracts
```

### Performance Investigation Pattern
```bash
# Multi-role performance debugging:

1. ARCHITECT -> ALL_SPECIALISTS
   Task: "Analyze performance in your domain"
   Parallel investigation across all areas

2. ALL_SPECIALISTS -> ARCHITECT  
   Results: Domain-specific findings
   
3. ARCHITECT synthesizes findings
   Identifies root cause and solution
   
4. ARCHITECT -> APPROPRIATE_SPECIALISTS
   Task: "Implement specific optimizations"
```

## Session Management Commands

### Role Status Check
```bash
# Check current role status
grep "Active Role:" .claude/memory/session-state.md

# View role task summary
grep -A 5 "Priority Tasks:" .claude/memory/session-state.md

# Check pending handoffs
grep -A 10 "Pending Handoffs:" .claude/memory/active-tasks.md
```

### Role History
```bash
# View recent role switches
tail -20 .claude/memory/session-state.md

# Analyze role session durations
grep "Session Start\|Session End" .claude/memory/session-state.md

# Find patterns in role coordination
grep "Handoffs Created" .claude/memory/session-state.md
```

### Role Performance Metrics
```bash
# Track role effectiveness
echo "## Role Performance Analysis" > .claude/memory/role-metrics.md
echo "**Date:** $(date)" >> .claude/memory/role-metrics.md
echo "" >> .claude/memory/role-metrics.md

# Count completed tasks by role
grep -c "COMPLETED.*ARCHITECT" .claude/memory/active-tasks.md
grep -c "COMPLETED.*FRONTEND" .claude/memory/active-tasks.md
grep -c "COMPLETED.*BACKEND" .claude/memory/active-tasks.md
```

## Success Patterns

1. **Clean Transitions**: Always save state before switching
2. **Context Preservation**: Don't lose important progress 
3. **Clear Handoffs**: Document what needs continuation
4. **Role Discipline**: Stay within role constraints
5. **Coordination Focus**: Remember integration points

## Remember

> "Each role is a specialized expert. Switch cleanly, stay focused, coordinate effectively."

This command system replicates Claude Swarm's instance switching while maintaining the benefits of specialized contexts and coordinated development.
