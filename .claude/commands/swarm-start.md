# ðŸš€ Swarm Start Command

## Quick Start Guide for Claude Swarm-Style Development

Launch coordinated multi-role development sessions using Claude Swarm patterns within Cursor.

## Quick Start Commands

### Initialize Swarm Session
```bash
# Start new coordinated development session
swarm-start --project [PROJECT_NAME]
swarm-start --feature [FEATURE_NAME] 
swarm-start --investigation [ISSUE_ID]

# Quick start with auto-generated session
swarm-start --auto

# Resume previous swarm session
swarm-start --resume [SESSION_ID]
```

### Basic Role Operations
```bash
# Switch to specific role
swarm-role architect
swarm-role frontend
swarm-role backend

# Create task for another role
swarm-task --to backend --priority high "Implement user authentication API"

# Check coordination status
swarm-status
swarm-status --role frontend
swarm-status --tasks
```

## Getting Started Workflows

### 1. Simple Feature Development
```markdown
## Scenario: Add user profile management feature

### Step 1: Initialize Session
```bash
swarm-start --feature user-profile-management
```

### Step 2: Start with Architecture
```
Role: ARCHITECT
Duration: 1-2 hours
Tasks:
- Design user profile data structure
- Define API contracts for profile CRUD operations  
- Plan UI components and user flows
- Create implementation guidance for specialists
```

### Step 3: Create Implementation Tasks
```bash
# From architect role, delegate to specialists
swarm-task --to backend --priority high \
  "Implement user profile API endpoints per specification in .claude/memory/api-contracts.md"

swarm-task --to frontend --priority high \
  "Build user profile UI components per design in .claude/memory/ui-specifications.md"

swarm-task --to database --priority medium \
  "Create user profile schema and migrations per .claude/memory/db-schema.md"
```

### Step 4: Coordinate Implementation
```bash
# Switch between roles as needed
swarm-role backend
# Implement API endpoints...

swarm-role frontend  
# Build UI components...

swarm-role database
# Create schema and migrations...
```

### Step 5: Integration and Testing
```bash
# Return to architect for integration
swarm-role architect
# Review implementations and coordinate integration testing
```
```

### 2. Performance Investigation
```markdown
## Scenario: Application response times increased 50%

### Step 1: Launch Investigation
```bash
swarm-start --investigation perf-response-time-001
```

### Step 2: Parallel Analysis Setup
```
Role: COORDINATOR  
Duration: 30 minutes
Tasks:
- Create investigation workspace
- Define analysis scope and timeline
- Set up parallel analysis tasks
```

### Step 3: Delegate Parallel Analysis
```bash
# Create simultaneous analysis tasks
swarm-task --to data-expert --priority critical \
  "Analyze performance metrics for last 48 hours, identify when degradation started"

swarm-task --to code-expert --priority critical \
  "Review recent deployments and code changes that might affect performance"

swarm-task --to infrastructure-expert --priority critical \
  "Check system resources, database performance, and scaling issues"
```

### Step 4: Execute Parallel Analysis  
```bash
# Work simultaneously in different roles
swarm-role data-expert
# Analyze metrics and user impact...

# In separate session or after completing data analysis:
swarm-role code-expert
# Review code changes and implementation...

# Continue with infrastructure analysis:
swarm-role infrastructure-expert  
# Check system performance and scaling...
```

### Step 5: Synthesize Findings
```bash
# Return to coordinator role
swarm-role coordinator
# Review all specialist findings
# Identify root cause and solution strategy
# Create implementation tasks for fixes
```
```

### 3. Security Review Process
```markdown
## Scenario: Comprehensive security review before major release

### Step 1: Security Review Initialization
```bash
swarm-start --security-review --scope full-application
```

### Step 2: Multi-Domain Security Analysis
```bash
# Create specialized security review tasks
swarm-task --to security-specialist --priority critical \
  "Perform comprehensive security audit of authentication system"

swarm-task --to backend-specialist --priority high \
  "Review API security implementations and validate input sanitization"

swarm-task --to frontend-specialist --priority high \
  "Audit client-side security measures and data handling"

swarm-task --to infrastructure-specialist --priority high \
  "Review deployment security and infrastructure hardening"
```

### Step 3: Coordinated Security Validation
```bash
# Each specialist focuses on their security domain
swarm-role security-specialist
# Perform security scans and vulnerability assessment...

swarm-role backend-specialist  
# Review API security and server-side protections...

swarm-role frontend-specialist
# Check client-side security and data protection...

swarm-role infrastructure-specialist
# Validate deployment and infrastructure security...
```
```

## Session Management

### Session State Tracking
```markdown
File: .claude/memory/swarm-session-state.md

## Active Swarm Session: [SESSION_ID]
**Type:** [FEATURE|INVESTIGATION|REVIEW|OPTIMIZATION]
**Started:** [TIMESTAMP]
**Current Phase:** [ARCHITECTURE|IMPLEMENTATION|INTEGRATION|COMPLETION]

### Active Roles:
- **Coordinator:** [STATUS] - [CURRENT_TASK]
- **Architect:** [STATUS] - [CURRENT_FOCUS]  
- **Frontend:** [STATUS] - [CURRENT_WORK]
- **Backend:** [STATUS] - [CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION]

### Coordination Points:
- **Next Integration:** [WHEN] - [PARTICIPANTS]
- **Pending Reviews:** [LIST]
- **Blocking Issues:** [ISSUES_WITH_OWNERS]

### Progress Tracking:

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Coordination Problems
```markdown
## Issue: Roles working in isolation without coordination

### Solution:
1. Increase coordination checkpoint frequency
2. Use shared workspace files more actively
3. Create explicit integration tasks
4. Set up regular status updates

### Commands:
```bash
# Force coordination check
swarm-status --coordination-required

# Create integration checkpoint  
swarm-checkpoint --roles [frontend,backend] --when now

# Set up regular status updates
swarm-schedule --status-update --interval 2h
```
```

### Context Loss Between Roles
```markdown
## Issue: Important decisions and context lost during role switches

### Solution:
1. Use structured session state saving
2. Document decisions immediately when made
3. Create handoff notes for role transitions
4. Maintain decision log accessible to all roles

### Commands:
```bash
# Save current state before role switch
swarm-save-state --role current --decisions --progress

# Load context for new role
swarm-load-context --role [TARGET_ROLE] --recent-decisions

# Document decision for all roles
swarm-decision --log "API authentication will use JWT tokens" --affects [frontend,backend]
```
```

### Over-Coordination Overhead
```markdown
## Issue: Coordination taking more time than development

### Solution:
1. Reduce number of active roles
2. Increase role session duration
3. Batch coordination activities
4. Use asynchronous handoffs instead of synchronous coordination

### Commands:
```bash
# Simplify to fewer roles
swarm-simplify --roles [architect,fullstack-developer]

# Extend role session time
swarm-configure --min-session-duration 2h

# Batch coordination
swarm-batch-coordination --schedule end-of-day
```
```

## Best Practices

### Session Planning
```
Before Starting Swarm Session:
âœ… Define clear objectives and scope
âœ… Identify which roles are actually needed
âœ… Estimate coordination overhead vs benefits
âœ… Plan integration and coordination points
âœ… Set realistic timeline expectations

During Swarm Session:
âœ… Document decisions and progress continuously
âœ… Coordinate at natural handoff points
âœ… Keep role boundaries clear and respected
âœ… Focus on deliverables and integration requirements
âœ… Regular status checks and coordination validation

After Swarm Session:
âœ… Document lessons learned and process improvements
âœ… Archive completed tasks and decisions
âœ… Plan follow-up work and next session priorities
âœ… Update patterns and templates based on experience
```

### Role Discipline
```
Maintain Role Focus:
âœ… Stay within role expertise boundaries
âœ… Delegate work outside expertise to appropriate roles
âœ… Document coordination needs rather than working around them
âœ… Use role constraints as quality gates
âœ… Escalate architectural decisions to architect role

Coordinate Effectively:
âœ… Use structured task delegation templates
âœ… Document integration contracts and dependencies
âœ… Communicate blockers and issues immediately
âœ… Plan coordination activities during role design
âœ… Balance coordination with individual productivity
```

## Success Metrics

### Track Session Effectiveness
```bash
# Generate session performance report
swarm-report --session [SESSION_ID] --metrics all

# Key metrics to monitor:
- Total development time vs estimated single-role time
- Coordination overhead as percentage of total time
- Number of integration issues caught vs missed
- Quality improvements from specialist review
- Developer satisfaction with role utilization
```

## Remember

> "Start simple with 2-3 roles, add complexity only when it provides clear benefits. Coordination is a tool, not a goal."

Use swarm patterns to capture the coordination advantages of Claude Swarm while maintaining the development efficiency of Cursor.
