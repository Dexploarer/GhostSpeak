# 🤖 Claude Swarm Development Patterns

## Reusable Multi-Agent Development Patterns for Cursor

This pattern library consolidates Claude Swarm's multi-agent coordination concepts into reusable templates for complex development workflows within Cursor.

## Core Pattern Categories

### 1. Role Specialization Patterns

#### Pattern: Expertise Isolation
```markdown
**Problem:** Single developer context overwhelmed by multiple domains
**Solution:** Specialized role contexts with clear boundaries

**Implementation:**
- Define distinct expertise areas (Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps)
- Create role-specific working directories and tool constraints
- Maintain role context through session switching protocols
- Document expertise boundaries and coordination points

**Example:**
```
FRONTEND_SPECIALIST:
  expertise: [React, TypeScript, CSS, UX]
  directory: ./frontend
  tools: [Edit, Write, Bash(npm:*)]
  constraints: [no-backend-changes, follow-api-contracts]
  coordination: [architect-approval-required, backend-integration-testing]
```

**When to Use:**
- Complex projects requiring multiple skill sets
- When different components need specialized attention
- To prevent context switching overhead in single sessions
```

#### Pattern: Coordinated Expertise
```markdown
**Problem:** Specialists working in isolation without coordination
**Solution:** Structured handoffs and integration protocols

**Implementation:**
- Create task delegation templates with clear inputs/outputs
- Define integration contracts between specialist roles
- Establish coordination checkpoints and approval processes
- Maintain shared workspace for cross-role communication

**Example:**
```
HANDOFF_TEMPLATE:
  from: ARCHITECT
  to: BACKEND_SPECIALIST
  deliverables:
    - API contract specification
    - Security requirements document
    - Performance benchmarks
  success_criteria:
    - Implementation matches specification
    - Security requirements satisfied
    - Performance targets met
```

**When to Use:**
- When specialist work depends on other specialist outputs
- For complex features requiring multiple expertise areas
- When coordination overhead exceeds individual productivity gains
```

### 2. Investigation and Analysis Patterns

#### Pattern: Parallel Investigation
```markdown
**Problem:** Complex issues require multiple perspectives simultaneously
**Solution:** Coordinated parallel analysis across expertise domains

**Implementation:**
- Break investigation into domain-specific analysis tasks
- Assign specialists to analyze their expertise areas simultaneously
- Create shared investigation workspace and findings repository
- Synthesize findings through coordinator role

**Template:**
```
INVESTIGATION: [ISSUE_ID]
parallel_tasks:
  - role: DATA_EXPERT
    focus: metrics_analysis
    deliverable: quantified_impact_assessment
  - role: CODE_EXPERT  
    focus: implementation_review
    deliverable: root_cause_analysis
  - role: INFRASTRUCTURE_EXPERT
    focus: system_analysis
    deliverable: environment_impact_assessment
coordination:
  synthesis_role: COORDINATOR
  timeline: 4_hours_parallel + 2_hours_synthesis
  shared_workspace: .claude/memory/investigation-[ISSUE_ID].md
```

**When to Use:**
- Performance issues requiring multi-domain analysis
- Security incidents needing comprehensive assessment
- Complex bugs with unclear root causes
- System optimization requiring holistic approach
```

#### Pattern: Progressive Investigation
```markdown
**Problem:** Investigation requires building understanding incrementally
**Solution:** Sequential deepening with specialist handoffs

**Implementation:**
- Start with broad coordinator analysis to identify focus areas
- Hand off specific areas to specialists for deep analysis
- Return to coordinator for synthesis and next-level questions
- Iterate until root cause identified and solution validated

**Template:**
```
PROGRESSIVE_INVESTIGATION:
  phase_1: 
    role: COORDINATOR
    task: broad_system_analysis
    output: focus_areas_identified
  phase_2:
    parallel_specialist_analysis: [DATA, CODE, INFRASTRUCTURE]
    output: domain_specific_findings
  phase_3:
    role: COORDINATOR  
    task: synthesis_and_hypothesis_formation
    output: working_theory_with_evidence
  phase_4:
    role: ASSIGNED_SPECIALIST
    task: hypothesis_validation_and_solution_design
    output: validated_solution_approach
```

**When to Use:**
- When initial problem scope is unclear
- For learning-intensive investigations
- When solution requires iterative refinement
- For complex technical debt analysis
```

### 3. Development Coordination Patterns

#### Pattern: Feature Development Workflow
```markdown
**Problem:** Complex features require coordinated development across multiple areas
**Solution:** Orchestrated multi-role development with integration checkpoints

**Implementation:**
- Architect designs system and creates implementation guidance
- Specialists implement in parallel within their domains
- Regular integration checkpoints ensure coordination
- Final integration and testing phase before completion

**Template:**
```
FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT: [FEATURE_NAME]
  phase_1_architecture:
    role: ARCHITECT
    duration: 1-2_days
    deliverables:
      - system_design_document
      - api_contracts
      - integration_specifications
      - implementation_guidance
      
  phase_2_parallel_implementation:
    duration: 3-5_days
    tasks:
      - role: FRONTEND
        focus: ui_components_and_user_experience
        constraints: follow_api_contracts
      - role: BACKEND
        focus: api_implementation_and_business_logic
        constraints: follow_security_requirements
      - role: DATABASE
        focus: schema_and_data_layer
        constraints: follow_performance_requirements
        
  phase_3_integration:
    role: ALL_COORDINATED
    duration: 1-2_days
    focus: cross_domain_testing_and_integration
    deliverables: integrated_feature_ready_for_deployment
```

**When to Use:**
- Features requiring multiple technical domains
- When parallel development can accelerate delivery
- For features with complex integration requirements
- When team coordination benefits outweigh overhead
```

#### Pattern: Incremental Integration
```markdown
**Problem:** Large features are risky to integrate all at once
**Solution:** Progressive integration with validation at each step

**Implementation:**
- Break feature into integrable increments
- Implement and integrate each increment separately
- Validate functionality and performance at each integration
- Build confidence and reduce risk through incremental delivery

**Template:**
```
INCREMENTAL_INTEGRATION: [FEATURE_NAME]
  increment_1:
    scope: core_data_models_and_basic_api
    roles: [BACKEND, DATABASE]
    integration_test: api_endpoints_functional
    
  increment_2:
    scope: basic_ui_components_with_api_integration
    roles: [FRONTEND, BACKEND]
    integration_test: end_to_end_basic_workflow
    
  increment_3:
    scope: advanced_features_and_optimization
    roles: [ALL]
    integration_test: full_feature_acceptance_testing
    
  deployment_strategy: increment_by_increment_with_feature_flags
```

**When to Use:**
- Large, complex features with high integration risk
- When early user feedback is valuable
- For learning-intensive development
- When incremental delivery provides business value
```

### 4. Quality Assurance Patterns

#### Pattern: Multi-Role Code Review
```markdown
**Problem:** Single-person code review misses domain-specific issues
**Solution:** Specialized review by relevant expertise areas

**Implementation:**
- Route code changes to appropriate specialist reviewers
- Each specialist reviews within their expertise domain
- Coordinate feedback and ensure all concerns addressed
- Final architectural review for system-wide impact

**Template:**
```
MULTI_ROLE_REVIEW: [PULL_REQUEST_ID]
  architectural_review:
    role: ARCHITECT
    focus: [system_design_alignment, integration_impact]
    
  domain_reviews:
    - role: FRONTEND (if frontend changes)
      focus: [component_patterns, performance, accessibility]
    - role: BACKEND (if backend changes)  
      focus: [api_design, security, performance]
    - role: DATABASE (if schema changes)
      focus: [data_integrity, query_performance, migration_safety]
      
  coordination:
    all_reviews_required: true
    conflict_resolution: escalate_to_architect
    final_approval: architect_after_all_specialist_approval
```

**When to Use:**
- Critical code changes affecting multiple domains
- When specialized expertise is needed for proper review
- For security-sensitive changes
- When learning and knowledge transfer are important
```

#### Pattern: Progressive Quality Gates
```markdown
**Problem:** Quality issues discovered late in development process
**Solution:** Quality validation at each development phase

**Implementation:**
- Define quality criteria for each development phase
- Validate quality at role handoff points
- Escalate quality issues immediately when discovered
- Prevent progression until quality standards met

**Template:**
```
PROGRESSIVE_QUALITY_GATES:
  architecture_phase:
    quality_gates:
      - design_review_completed
      - security_requirements_defined
      - performance_benchmarks_established
    exit_criteria: architect_approval_documented
    
  implementation_phase:
    quality_gates:
      - code_follows_established_patterns
      - unit_tests_passing_with_coverage
      - security_requirements_implemented
    exit_criteria: specialist_self_validation_complete
    
  integration_phase:
    quality_gates:
      - integration_tests_passing
      - performance_benchmarks_met
      - security_scan_passing
    exit_criteria: multi_role_validation_complete
```

**When to Use:**
- When quality is critical and rework is expensive
- For regulated or security-sensitive development
- When team is learning new technologies or patterns
- For complex integrations with high failure risk
```

### 5. Session Management Patterns

#### Pattern: Context Preservation
```markdown
**Problem:** Switching between roles loses important context and progress
**Solution:** Structured context saving and restoration

**Implementation:**
- Document current state before role switches
- Create structured handoff notes for role transitions
- Maintain session history and decision log
- Restore context systematically when resuming roles

**Template:**
```
SESSION_TRANSITION:
  pre_switch:
    save_current_state:
      - current_task_progress
      - decisions_made_this_session
      - blockers_and_issues_encountered
      - handoff_tasks_for_other_roles
    document_location: .claude/memory/session-state.md
    
  post_switch:
    load_target_context:
      - review_pending_tasks_for_role
      - check_handoffs_received
      - validate_integration_requirements
      - set_working_directory_and_constraints
    context_file: .claude/memory/[ROLE]-context.md
```

**When to Use:**
- When role switching is frequent
- For complex projects requiring multiple sessions
- When context loss significantly impacts productivity
- For knowledge-intensive work requiring deep context
```

#### Pattern: Coordination State Management
```markdown
**Problem:** Multiple roles lose track of overall project coordination
**Solution:** Centralized coordination state with role-specific views

**Implementation:**
- Maintain central project state accessible to all roles
- Provide role-specific filtered views of relevant information
- Update coordination state at each significant decision or milestone
- Use coordination state to guide role switching decisions

**Template:**
```
COORDINATION_STATE:
  project_status:
    current_phase: [ARCHITECTURE|IMPLEMENTATION|INTEGRATION|DEPLOYMENT]
    active_features: [list_with_owners_and_status]
    blocking_issues: [list_with_owners_and_eta]
    
  role_status:
    architect: [current_focus, pending_decisions, coordination_needs]
    frontend: [current_tasks, blockers, integration_dependencies]  
    backend: [current_work, security_status, api_readiness]
    
  integration_status:
    frontend_backend: [api_contracts_status, integration_test_status]
    backend_database: [schema_alignment, performance_validation]
    
  next_coordination_events:
    - type: integration_checkpoint
      participants: [frontend, backend]
      scheduled: [timestamp]
    - type: architecture_review
      participants: [all, architect_lead]
      trigger: implementation_phase_complete
```

**When to Use:**
- For complex projects with multiple parallel work streams
- When coordination overhead is significant
- For distributed or asynchronous development
- When project visibility is important for stakeholders
```

## Pattern Selection Guidelines

### When to Use Multi-Role Patterns
```
Use multi-role patterns when:
✅ Project complexity exceeds single-person cognitive capacity
✅ Multiple specialized skill sets are genuinely required
✅ Parallel work can accelerate development significantly  
✅ Quality benefits from specialized review and validation
✅ Risk reduction through expertise separation is valuable

Avoid multi-role patterns when:
❌ Project is simple enough for single-context development
❌ Coordination overhead exceeds productivity benefits
❌ All required expertise exists in single developer context
❌ Time pressure requires rapid single-threaded development
❌ Learning project where broad context is more valuable than specialization
```

### Pattern Complexity Scaling
```
Simple Projects (< 1 week):
- Use single role with occasional architect consultation
- Minimal coordination overhead
- Focus on rapid delivery

Medium Projects (1-4 weeks):
- Use 2-3 specialized roles with structured handoffs
- Regular coordination checkpoints
- Balance specialization with coordination efficiency

Complex Projects (> 1 month):
- Full multi-role coordination with all patterns
- Formal coordination processes and documentation
- Optimization for long-term maintainability and quality
```
