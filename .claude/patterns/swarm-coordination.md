# üåü Swarm Coordination Patterns

## Essential Multi-Agent Development Patterns from Claude Swarm

Quick reference patterns for implementing Claude Swarm-style coordination in Cursor development.

## Core Coordination Patterns

### 1. Parallel Specialist Investigation
```yaml
# When: Complex issues need multiple expert perspectives
# Pattern: Assign same issue to different domain experts simultaneously

investigation_pattern:
  trigger: "Performance degradation affecting multiple systems"
  
  parallel_tasks:
    data_expert:
      focus: "Metrics analysis and user impact quantification"
      deliverable: "Performance timeline with specific impact metrics"
      
    code_expert:
      focus: "Recent code changes and implementation review"  
      deliverable: "Root cause analysis with code-level evidence"
      
    infrastructure_expert:
      focus: "System resources and configuration analysis"
      deliverable: "Infrastructure bottleneck identification"
      
  coordination:
    duration: "2-4 hours parallel + 1 hour synthesis"
    coordinator: "ARCHITECT role"
    shared_workspace: ".claude/memory/investigation-{ID}.md"
```

### 2. Sequential Task Delegation  
```yaml
# When: Work requires building on previous specialist output
# Pattern: Hand off completed work to next appropriate specialist

delegation_chain:
  step_1:
    role: "ARCHITECT"
    task: "Design API contracts and system integration"
    output: "API specification and integration requirements"
    
  step_2:
    role: "BACKEND"
    input: "API specification from architect"
    task: "Implement API endpoints with security and performance"
    output: "Working API with tests and documentation"
    
  step_3:
    role: "FRONTEND"  
    input: "Working API from backend"
    task: "Build UI components with API integration"
    output: "Complete user interface with backend integration"
    
  coordination_points:
    - "API contract review between architect and backend"
    - "Integration testing between backend and frontend"
    - "Final system validation with all roles"
```

### 3. Expertise Isolation
```yaml
# When: Different parts of system need specialized knowledge
# Pattern: Constrain roles to their expertise domains

role_boundaries:
  frontend_specialist:
    expertise: ["React", "TypeScript", "CSS", "UX"]
    directory: "./frontend"
    constraints: 
      - "Cannot modify backend API endpoints"
      - "Must follow API contracts from architect"
      - "Focus only on UI/UX implementation"
    tools: ["Edit", "Write", "Bash(npm:*)"]
    
  backend_specialist:
    expertise: ["Node.js", "APIs", "Database", "Security"]
    directory: "./backend"
    constraints:
      - "Cannot modify frontend components"
      - "Must implement API contracts exactly as specified"
      - "Responsible for all security measures"
    tools: ["Edit", "Write", "Bash", "Database"]
    
  coordination_protocol:
    - "All cross-domain changes must go through architect"
    - "Integration contracts must be documented and agreed"
    - "Changes affecting other domains require coordination task"
```

### 4. Progressive Quality Gates
```yaml
# When: Quality issues are expensive to fix later
# Pattern: Validate quality at each handoff point

quality_gates:
  architecture_phase:
    exit_criteria:
      - "Design review completed and documented"
      - "Security requirements clearly defined"
      - "Performance benchmarks established"
    validator: "ARCHITECT"
    
  implementation_phase:
    exit_criteria:
      - "Code follows established patterns"
      - "Unit tests pass with required coverage"
      - "Security requirements implemented"
    validator: "SPECIALIST_SELF + ARCHITECT_REVIEW"
    
  integration_phase:
    exit_criteria:
      - "Integration tests pass"
      - "Performance benchmarks met"
      - "Cross-domain functionality validated"
    validator: "ALL_ROLES_COORDINATED"
```

## Quick Implementation Templates

### Task Delegation Template
```markdown
**Task:** [TASK_ID]
**From:** [SOURCE_ROLE] -> **To:** [TARGET_ROLE]
**Type:** [RESEARCH|IMPLEMENTATION|REVIEW|COORDINATION]

**Context:** [Why this task exists]
**Objective:** [What needs to be achieved]
**Input:** [What the target role receives]
**Expected Output:** [What should be delivered]
**Success Criteria:** [How to know it's done]

**Working Directory:** [Path]
**Tools Required:** [List]
**Deadline:** [When needed]
**Status:** [PENDING|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETED]
```

### Role Switch Checklist
```markdown
## Pre-Switch (Save State)
- [ ] Update current task status in .claude/memory/active-tasks.md
- [ ] Document progress and decisions made
- [ ] Note any blockers or coordination needs
- [ ] Create handoff tasks for other roles if needed

## Post-Switch (Load Context)  
- [ ] Review pending tasks for new role
- [ ] Check integration requirements and dependencies
- [ ] Load role-specific context and constraints
- [ ] Validate working directory and tool setup
```

### Investigation Coordination Template
```markdown
# Investigation: [ISSUE_DESCRIPTION]
**Priority:** [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
**Impact:** [User/business impact description]

## Parallel Analysis Tasks
- **Data Expert:** Analyze metrics for [timeframe] 
- **Code Expert:** Review changes in [affected areas]
- **Infrastructure Expert:** Check [system components]

## Coordination Plan
- **Duration:** [X hours parallel + Y hours synthesis]
- **Shared Workspace:** .claude/memory/investigation-[ID].md
- **Synthesis Role:** [COORDINATOR]
- **Success Criteria:** [Root cause identified with evidence]
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Multi-Role Patterns
```
‚úÖ Use When:
- Project complexity requires multiple specialized skills
- Parallel work can significantly accelerate development
- Quality benefits from expert review in each domain
- Integration complexity requires careful coordination

‚ùå Avoid When:
- Simple projects manageable by single context
- Coordination overhead exceeds productivity benefits
- Time pressure requires rapid single-threaded development
- Team is learning and needs broad context exposure
```

### Pattern Selection by Project Size
```
Small (< 1 week):
- Single role with architect consultation
- Minimal coordination overhead

Medium (1-4 weeks):  
- 2-3 specialized roles
- Structured handoffs
- Regular coordination checkpoints

Large (> 1 month):
- Full multi-role coordination
- All patterns and formal processes
- Optimize for long-term quality
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Mistakes
```
‚ùå Role Boundary Violations
- Frontend modifying backend APIs directly
- Backend changing UI components
- Skipping architectural review for system changes

‚ùå Poor Coordination
- Specialists working in complete isolation
- No shared understanding of integration points
- Decisions made without consulting affected roles

‚ùå Context Loss
- Switching roles without saving state
- Losing important decisions and progress
- No documentation of coordination requirements

‚ùå Over-Engineering
- Using multi-role patterns for simple tasks
- Creating coordination overhead that exceeds benefits
- Forcing role separation where it doesn't add value
```

## Success Metrics

### Track These Indicators
```
Efficiency Metrics:
- Feature completion time vs single-role baseline
- Coordination overhead as % of total development
- Integration issues caught before deployment

Quality Metrics:
- Defect rate in multi-role vs single-role development
- Security issues found in specialized review
- Performance regressions prevented by expert analysis

Team Metrics:
- Developer satisfaction with expertise utilization
- Knowledge transfer between roles
- Context switching impact on productivity
```

## Remember

> "Coordination is an investment. Make sure the returns justify the costs. Start simple, add complexity only when it provides clear benefits."
