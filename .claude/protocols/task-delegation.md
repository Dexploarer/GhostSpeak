```

## Delegation Workflow

### Phase 1: Task Creation
```
1. IDENTIFY DELEGATION NEED
   - Current role has task outside expertise
   - Need input from specific specialist
   - Require coordination between roles
   - Architecture decision needed

2. CREATE TASK SPECIFICATION
   - Use task template above
   - Be specific about inputs/outputs
   - Define success criteria clearly
   - Identify dependencies and blockers

3. LOG TASK
   File: .claude/memory/active-tasks.md
   Add task with PENDING status
   Cross-reference in source role's session notes
```

### Phase 2: Context Preparation
```
1. PREPARE HANDOFF MATERIALS
   - Gather all required inputs
   - Document current state/progress
   - Identify specific questions/concerns
   - Create reference materials if needed

2. SET UP TARGET CONTEXT
   - Define working directory
   - Prepare system prompt override if needed
   - Ensure tool requirements are met
   - Set up integration points

3. DOCUMENT COORDINATION PLAN
   - How will progress be tracked?
   - When are check-ins needed?
   - What triggers escalation?
   - How to handle blockers?
```

### Phase 3: Role Switching and Execution
```
1. SWITCH TO TARGET ROLE
   - Load target role context
   - Apply system prompt override if specified
   - Set working directory
   - Review task requirements

2. EXECUTE TASK
   - Focus only on delegated work
   - Follow constraints and requirements
   - Document progress and decisions
   - Identify any new coordination needs

3. TRACK PROGRESS
   - Update task status regularly
   - Note blockers immediately
   - Document intermediate results
   - Communicate significant findings
```

### Phase 4: Task Completion and Handback
```
1. FINALIZE DELIVERABLES
   - Ensure all requirements met
   - Format output as specified
   - Include documentation/rationale
   - Test integration points if applicable

2. UPDATE TASK STATUS
   - Mark as COMPLETED
   - Link to output location
   - Note any follow-up tasks needed
   - Document lessons learned

3. COORDINATE HANDBACK
   - Notify source role of completion
   - Provide summary of key findings
   - Highlight any unexpected issues
   - Recommend next steps
```

## Task Management Commands

### Creating Tasks
```bash
# Use this structure in .claude/memory/active-tasks.md

## Quick Task Template
**Task:** [AUTO_GENERATED_ID]
**From:** [CURRENT_ROLE] -> **To:** [TARGET_ROLE]
**Objective:** [ONE_LINE_SUMMARY]
**Priority:** [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
**Status:** PENDING

### Requirements
- [REQUIREMENT_1]
- [REQUIREMENT_2]

### Expected Output
- [DELIVERABLE_1]
- [DELIVERABLE_2]

**Created:** [TIMESTAMP]
```

### Status Tracking
```bash
# Status Update Template
**Task:** [TASK_ID]
**Status:** [NEW_STATUS]
**Progress:** [CURRENT_STATE]
**Updated:** [TIMESTAMP]
**Notes:** [PROGRESS_NOTES]
```

### Task Queries
```bash
# Find tasks by role
grep -A 10 "To: Backend Specialist" .claude/memory/active-tasks.md

# Find high priority tasks  
grep -A 5 "Priority: HIGH" .claude/memory/active-tasks.md

# Find blocked tasks
grep -A 5 "Status: BLOCKED" .claude/memory/active-tasks.md
```

## Integration with Multi-Agent Workflow

### Task Coordination Points
```
1. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS
   - Always delegate complex decisions to Architect
   - Provide full context and options analysis
   - Include impact assessment

2. CROSS-DOMAIN WORK
   - Frontend changes affecting backend -> coordinate
   - Database schema changes -> review with all affected roles
   - Security changes -> involve all roles in review

3. INTEGRATION TESTING
   - Create tasks for testing coordination
   - Define success criteria clearly
   - Plan rollback procedures

4. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER
   - Document learnings for team knowledge base
   - Create tasks for sharing specialized insights
   - Build up team expertise over time
```

### Performance Optimization
```
# Task delegation patterns for performance work

1. ANALYSIS PHASE
   Architect -> Specialists: "Analyze performance in your domain"
   Parallel tasks to Frontend, Backend, Database experts

2. SYNTHESIS PHASE  
   Specialists -> Architect: "Consolidate findings and plan"
   Sequential tasks for root cause analysis

3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
   Architect -> Specialists: "Implement agreed optimizations"  
   Coordinated parallel implementation

4. VALIDATION PHASE
   All -> Architect: "Validate improvements and measure"
   Coordinated testing and measurement
```

## Success Patterns

1. **Specific Tasks**: Vague tasks lead to poor results - be precise
2. **Clear Handoffs**: Both context and expected output must be crystal clear
3. **Progress Tracking**: Update status frequently to catch issues early
4. **Context Preservation**: Don't lose important decisions in role switches
5. **Coordination Focus**: Always consider how work affects other roles

## Remember

> "Effective delegation multiplies capability. Poor delegation multiplies confusion. Be specific, be clear, be coordinated."

This protocol transforms Claude Swarm's MCP communication into structured, documented coordination within Cursor's single-session constraint.
