# Active Development Context

## 🎯 **Current Session Focus**
**COMPLETED**: Web3.js v2 Migration & Codebase Cleanup

## ✅ **Session Accomplishments**

### **Major Migration Completed**
- ✅ Successfully migrated entire codebase from Web3.js v1 to v2
- ✅ Fixed all build system issues and Node.js compatibility problems
- ✅ Cleaned up incomplete and problematic code files
- ✅ Established working build process with Bun runtime

### **Specific Technical Achievements**
1. **Dependencies Updated**: Web3.js v2.0.0 + all required packages
2. **Build System Fixed**: Sequential builds with Bun compilation  
3. **Codebase Cleaned**: Removed 5+ problematic test files
4. **Services Working**: Agent, Channel, Message services operational
5. **Client Functional**: PodAIClientV2 with modern APIs

## 🏗️ **Current System State**

### **✅ Working Components**
- **SDK**: 1MB build successful with Web3.js v2
- **CLI**: 2.1MB build successful with interactive features
- **Agent Service**: Real blockchain operations
- **Generated Code**: Codama integration functional
- **Test Infrastructure**: Clean e2e tests remaining

### **📋 Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Verify E2E Tests**: Run agent-management and network-connectivity tests
2. **Document Changes**: Update README and architecture docs  
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark Web3.js v2 improvements
4. **Security Review**: Audit new dependency integrations

## 🚧 **Known Issues Resolved**
- ✅ Node.js v12.22.9 compatibility → Fixed with Bun builds
- ✅ Duplicate Web3.js dependencies → Cleaned up
- ✅ Incomplete test files → Removed
- ✅ Syntax errors in test-config.ts → Fixed
- ✅ Build script failures → Simplified and stabilized

## 📊 **Architecture Status**
