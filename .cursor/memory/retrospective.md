  status: 'PASS' | 'FAIL' | 'SKIP' | 'BLOCKED';
  details: string;
  error?: string;
}

// Enables systematic validation and progress tracking
```

## ‚ùå **CRITICAL FAILURES & LESSONS**

### **1. Late Discovery of Codec Compatibility Issues**
**Problem**: Codec compatibility issues discovered late in development cycle
**Impact**: Blocked MarketplaceService integration and delayed completion
**Root Cause**: Insufficient early testing of generated instruction builders

**What Went Wrong**:
- **Late Integration Testing**: Generated code not tested until service integration
- **Assumption of Compatibility**: Assumed Codama/Kinobi would generate compatible code
- **Lack of Codec Validation**: No early validation of Web3.js v2 codec imports

**Lesson Learned**: üéì **Test generated code immediately after generation**

**Prevention Strategy**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Should have tested immediately:
describe('Generated Instruction Builders', () => {
  it('should compile and import correctly', () => {
    expect(() => {
      const instruction = createServiceListing({ /* params */ });
    }).not.toThrow();
  });
});
```

**Process Improvement**:
- **Early Codec Validation**: Test all generated code for import compatibility
- **Generation Pipeline Testing**: Include codec compatibility in CI/CD
- **Incremental Integration**: Test instruction builders before service integration

---

### **2. Mock Implementation Technical Debt**
**Problem**: Initial mock implementations hidden until late in development
**Impact**: False sense of progress, late discovery of real implementation complexity
**Root Cause**: Prototyping approach continued too long into development

**What Went Wrong**:
- **Prototype Mentality**: Started with mock implementations "temporarily"
- **Hidden Complexity**: Real blockchain integration more complex than mocks suggested
- **Late Real Implementation**: Delayed replacing mocks with real implementations
- **Testing Blind Spots**: Mock implementations passed tests that real implementations failed

**Anti-Pattern Identified**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå This pattern caused problems:
class EscrowService {
  async processPayment(params: any): Promise<any> {
    console.log('Mock: Processing payment', params);
    return { success: true, txId: 'mock-123' }; // Hidden complexity
  }
}
```

**Lesson Learned**: üéì **Real implementations from day one, no exceptions**

**Current Standard**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct pattern enforced:
class EscrowService {
  async processPayment(params: ProcessPaymentParams): Promise<TransactionResult> {
    const instruction = processPayment(params); // Real instruction
    const transaction = pipe(
      createSolanaTransaction({ version: 0 }),
      (tx) => addTransactionInstructions([instruction], tx)
    );
    return this.sendAndConfirmTransaction(transaction, params.signer);
  }
}
```

---

### **3. Insufficient Dependency Research**
**Problem**: Dependency choices made without sufficient research
**Impact**: Compatibility issues, outdated patterns, integration problems
**Root Cause**: Relying on pre-training knowledge instead of current research

**What Went Wrong**:
- **Training Data Reliance**: Used 2024 training data in 2025 development
- **Insufficient Context7 Usage**: Didn't research current best practices early enough
- **Package Assumption**: Assumed package compatibility without verification
- **Late Discovery**: Found incompatibilities after significant development

**Lesson Learned**: üéì **Research everything before implementation, training data is outdated**

**New Process**:
1. **Before ANY implementation**: Research current patterns with Context7
2. **Multiple source validation**: Cross-reference 3+ authoritative sources  
3. **Compatibility testing**: Test package compatibility before adoption
4. **Documentation verification**: Ensure documentation matches reality

---

## üîß **PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Research-Driven Development Protocol**
**Problem**: Decisions made without current information
**Solution**: Mandatory research before any implementation

**New Process**:
```bash
# REQUIRED BEFORE ANY CODE:
1. Context7 Query: "use context7 [technology] best practices 2025"
2. Web Search: Current patterns and compatibility
3. Multi-source validation: 3+ authoritative sources
4. Compatibility testing: Verify packages work together
5. Documentation: Record research findings in memory
```

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Prevented multiple compatibility issues
- ‚úÖ Discovered optimal patterns before implementation
- ‚úÖ Saved significant rework time
- ‚úÖ Improved code quality and consistency

---

### **2. Real Implementation Enforcement**
**Problem**: Mock implementations hiding complexity
**Solution**: Absolute prohibition of mock/stub code

**New Standards**:
- ‚ùå **Prohibited**: Mock implementations in production code paths
- ‚ùå **Prohibited**: TODO comments for critical functionality
- ‚ùå **Prohibited**: Placeholder data in services
- ‚úÖ **Required**: Real blockchain transactions for all operations
- ‚úÖ **Required**: Comprehensive error handling for real failure modes

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
- Code review checklist includes "no mock implementations"
- CI/CD checks for mock/stub patterns
- Integration tests require real blockchain operations
- Documentation must show real usage examples

---

### **3. Incremental Integration Testing**
**Problem**: Late discovery of integration issues
**Solution**: Test integration at every development milestone

**New Testing Strategy**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Integration testing at each step:
describe('Incremental Integration', () => {
  it('should test generated code immediately', () => {
    // Test instruction builders compile and import
  });
  
  it('should test service integration immediately', () => {
    // Test service uses real instructions
  });
  
  it('should test end-to-end workflow immediately', () => {
    // Test complete user workflow
  });
});
```

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Caught codec issues earlier in development
- ‚úÖ Reduced rework and debugging time
- ‚úÖ Improved confidence in integration points
- ‚úÖ Better progress visibility
