# Feature Development Workflow - Pod Protocol Core

## Overview

This workflow defines the complete process for developing features in the core pod protocol, from research to deployment.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Research & Planning Phase

**Status**: `RESEARCHING` → `PLANNING`

#### Knowledge Acquisition

- [ ] Use Context7 MCP to research required libraries and dependencies
- [ ] Document all research findings in `llm-context-library/`
- [ ] Update `decisionLog.md` with technical research decisions
- [ ] Validate approach with existing architecture patterns

#### Requirements Analysis

- [ ] Define clear feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Identify impacted components (smart contract, SDKs, tests)
- [ ] Plan integration points with existing protocol features
- [ ] Document security and performance requirements

#### Technical Design

- [ ] Create ADR (Architectural Decision Record) in `adr/` directory
- [ ] Design smart contract instruction and account changes
- [ ] Plan SDK interface changes for both Rust and TypeScript
- [ ] Design comprehensive test strategy

### 2. Implementation Phase

**Status**: `PLANNING` → `IMPLEMENTING`

#### Smart Contract Development

- [ ] Implement smart contract changes in `packages/core/src/lib.rs`
- [ ] Add new instructions, accounts, and validation logic
- [ ] Implement error handling and security measures
- [ ] Add program events for monitoring and indexing
- [ ] Update account space calculations if needed

#### SDK Development

- [ ] Update Rust SDK in `packages/sdk-rust/`
  - [ ] Add new service methods and types
  - [ ] Update client interface
  - [ ] Add utility functions
- [ ] Update TypeScript SDK in `packages/sdk-typescript/`
  - [ ] Add corresponding service methods and types
  - [ ] Update client interface
  - [ ] Add utility functions

#### Test Implementation

- [ ] Implement smart contract unit tests
- [ ] Implement SDK unit tests (both Rust and TypeScript)
- [ ] Create integration tests for new functionality
- [ ] Add security-focused test cases
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks if applicable

### 3. Testing & Validation Phase

**Status**: `IMPLEMENTING` → `TESTING`

#### Local Testing

- [ ] Run all unit tests and achieve required coverage
- [ ] Run integration tests against local test validator
- [ ] Perform security testing and vulnerability analysis
- [ ] Execute performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test error conditions and edge cases

#### CI/CD Validation

- [ ] Ensure all CI/CD tests pass
- [ ] Verify code coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Validate security scan results
- [ ] Review performance benchmark results
- [ ] Confirm linting and formatting standards

#### Staging Testing

- [ ] Deploy to testnet/devnet for integration testing
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of complete workflows
- [ ] Validate with realistic data and scenarios
- [ ] Test upgrade procedures if applicable
- [ ] Gather performance metrics under load

### 4. Review & Revision Phase

**Status**: `TESTING` → `REVISING` (if needed)

#### Code Review

- [ ] Submit pull request with comprehensive description
- [ ] Address code review feedback
- [ ] Ensure all security requirements are met
- [ ] Validate architectural consistency
- [ ] Confirm documentation completeness

#### Quality Assurance

- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Confirm test coverage requirements are satisfied
- [ ] Validate security protocols compliance
- [ ] Review performance impact
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility if applicable

### 5. Documentation & Deployment

**Status**: `REVISING` → `COMPLETED`

#### Documentation

- [ ] Update API documentation for all changes
- [ ] Add usage examples and guides
- [ ] Update architectural documentation if needed
- [ ] Document any breaking changes
- [ ] Update changelog and release notes

#### Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Tag release version if applicable
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts and procedures
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of upcoming changes
- [ ] Schedule deployment window
