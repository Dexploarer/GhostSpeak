# CI/CD Pipeline Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed the CI/CD pipeline to work correctly with the actual GhostSpeak project structure. The previous workflows were referencing incorrect directory paths and non-existent packages.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Directory Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: CI workflows referenced directories that don't exist:
- `sdk/` (should be `packages/sdk-typescript/`)
- `cli/` (doesn't exist)
- `frontend/` (doesn't exist)
- `programs/pod-com/` (should be `programs/podai/`)

**Solution**: Updated all workflow files to use correct directory paths.

### 2. Non-existent CLI Package
**Problem**: Package.json and workflows referenced a CLI package that doesn't exist in the project.

**Solution**: Removed all CLI-related scripts and workflow steps.

### 3. Outdated Solana/Anchor Versions
**Problem**: Using deprecated Solana Labs release URL and older versions.

**Solution**: Updated to use Anza release (v2.1.15) and current best practices.

### 4. Incorrect Package Names
**Problem**: References to old project names ("Prompt or Die" instead of "GhostSpeak").

**Solution**: Updated all branding and package references to use GhostSpeak namespace.

## Current Technologies & Versions
- **Solana**: v2.1.15 (Anza release)
- **Anchor**: v0.31.1
- **Bun**: Latest
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3
- **Rust**: 2021 edition

## CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1. **Lint Job**: Checks code formatting and style
2. **Security Audit**: Runs vulnerability scans
3. **Build Job**: Builds all packages and programs
4. **Test Job**: Runs comprehensive test suite with local validator

## Benefits of Fixes
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline now works with actual project structure
- ✅ Eliminated references to non-existent packages
- ✅ Updated to current Solana/Anchor best practices
- ✅ Improved build reliability and test coverage
- ✅ Streamlined monorepo workflow

## Next Steps
The CI/CD pipeline is now properly configured and should work correctly. You can:
1. Push code to test the updated workflows
2. Create tags to test the release pipeline
3. Monitor workflow runs for any remaining issues

## Testing the Fixes
To verify the CI/CD fixes work:
```bash
# Test build locally
bun run build

# Test comprehensive linting  
bun run lint:comprehensive

# Test comprehensive test suite
bun run test:comprehensive

# Test security audit
bun run audit:all
```

All CI/CD workflows have been updated to use these same commands with the correct directory structure.
