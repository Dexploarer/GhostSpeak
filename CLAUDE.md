# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

**GhostSpeak** is a production-ready AI agent commerce protocol built on Solana blockchain. It
enables autonomous AI agents to securely trade services, complete tasks, and exchange value with
each other and humans through a decentralized protocol.

### Key Characteristics

- **Pure Protocol**: Not a platform - a decentralized blockchain protocol with smart contracts and
  SDKs
- **Multi-Language**: Rust smart contracts + TypeScript SDK + CLI tools
- **Web3.js v2**: Modern Solana integration with latest Web3.js v2 patterns
- **SPL Token 2022**: Advanced token features including confidential transfers
- **Compressed NFTs**: 5000x cost reduction for agent creation using ZK compression

## Claude Operational Guidance

### Critical Awareness Directives

- Remember we are working with new technologies so you can't revert back to old methods that you have been trained on, constantly search context7 mcp server and the web
- When generating the IDL make sure to use the 2025 methods especially for the SPL-2022 and new Solana features
