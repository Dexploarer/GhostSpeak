# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**GhostSpeak** is a production-ready AI agent commerce protocol built on Solana blockchain. It enables autonomous AI agents to securely trade services, complete tasks, and exchange value with each other and humans through a decentralized protocol.

### Key Characteristics

- **Pure Protocol**: Not a platform - a decentralized blockchain protocol with smart contracts and SDKs
- **Multi-Language**: Rust smart contracts + TypeScript SDK + CLI tools
- **Web3.js v2**: Modern Solana integration with latest Web3.js v2 patterns
- **SPL Token 2022**: Advanced token features including confidential transfers
- **Compressed NFTs**: 5000x cost reduction for agent creation using ZK compression

## Critical Awareness Directives

- Remember we are working with new technologies (July 2025) so you can't revert back to old methods that you have been trained on, constantly search context7 mcp server and the web
- When generating the IDL make sure to use the 2025 methods especially for the SPL-2022 and new Solana features
- This project uses **@solana/kit** (formerly @solana/web3.js v2) - do NOT use old @solana/web3.js v1 patterns
- Always use Anchor 0.31.1+ compatible patterns with Solana 2.1.0 (Agave)

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Development Goal (July 24, 2025)

- [ ] **NEEDS**: Performance-based reputation updates

**NO ADDITIONAL FEATURES** beyond this scope. This is our complete MVP.

## Development Memories & Context

### Current Status (July 24, 2025)
- **Rust Program**: âœ… Production-ready with 200+ error types, full validation, security
- **TypeScript SDK**: âœ… All instruction builders complete, IPFS integration ready
- **ElGamal**: ðŸŸ¡ Structure complete, needs ZK proof implementation
- **Token-2022**: ðŸŸ¡ Infrastructure ready, needs SPL program integration
- **ESLint/TypeScript**: âœ… 0 errors maintained
- **Package Manager**: âœ… Using bun for fast installs and modern workspace support
- **Next Priority**: Complete ElGamal proofs, then Token-2022 integration

### Technology Stack Specifics
- **Anchor Framework**: v0.31.1+ (July 2025 features)
- **Solana**: v2.1.0 (Agave client)
- **Web3.js**: v2+ (@solana/kit patterns only)
- **SPL Token 2022**: Latest with confidential transfers
- **Cryptography**: @noble/curves for ElGamal/ed25519
- **ZK Proofs**: Solana's ZK ElGamal Proof Program integration

### Architecture Patterns
- **Pure Protocol Design**: Smart contracts + SDKs, not a platform
- **Compressed NFTs**: 5000x cost reduction using ZK compression  
- **IPFS Integration**: Large content storage with automatic detection
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in anti-spam protection
- **Error Enhancement**: Detailed instruction-specific error messages

## Code Quality and Development Guidelines

### Absolute Requirements
- âœ… **0 ESLint errors** maintained at all times
- âœ… **100% TypeScript type safety** - NO `any` types except when absolutely required
- âœ… **All imports kept** unless proven unnecessary
- âœ… **Real implementation only** - no placeholders, mocks, or TODOs
- âœ… **ESLint + TypeScript checks** run after every task

### GhostSpeak-Specific Standards
- **Instruction Naming**: Use snake_case for Rust, camelCase for TypeScript
- **Account Validation**: Always use instruction-account-mapper for detailed errors  
- **RPC Calls**: Use TypedRpcClient interface, never raw `any` types
- **Token Operations**: Support both legacy Token and Token-2022 programs
- **Error Handling**: Use enhanced-client-errors for user-friendly messages
- **Crypto Operations**: Use @noble/curves, never custom implementations

### Testing Philosophy
- **Unit Tests**: Required for all crypto operations (ElGamal, proofs)
- **Integration Tests**: Required for all RPC queries and instruction builders
- **Property Tests**: Required for Token-2022 extension parsing
- **Error Tests**: Required for all error enhancement paths

### Security Standards
- **No Secret Exposure**: Never log or expose private keys, seeds, or sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: All public instructions must include rate limiting
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated at instruction level
- **PDA Security**: All PDAs use canonical derivation patterns
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All state-changing instructions protected

## Context7 Library Dependencies

When implementing features, always check these libraries for latest patterns:
- `/solana/web3js` - v2+ patterns and best practices
- `/anchor-lang/anchor` - Modern Anchor patterns for 2025
- `/solana/spl-token` - Token-2022 integration patterns
- `/noble/curves` - Cryptographic operations and ElGamal

## MCP Integration Notes

- **Web Search**: Use for latest Solana/Anchor documentation (July 2025)
- **Context7**: Use for up-to-date library patterns and examples
- **IPFS**: Use for large content storage implementation patterns
