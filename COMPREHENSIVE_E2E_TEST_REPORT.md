- **Result:** ✅ PASS
- **Details:**
  - Creates directory structure: `~/.ghostspeak/agents/{agent_id}/credentials.json`
  - Generates UUID mapping file for fast lookups
  - Stores complete credential information including wallet keys

### 3. UUID Lookup System
- **Test:** Look up agents by UUID
- **Result:** ✅ PASS
- **Command:** `npx ghostspeak agent uuid 4d060bbd-4cb2-4f45-8dc0-63bd5a6e6e34`
- **Output:**
  ```
  🤖 Agent Details:
  Name: Test Agent
  Agent ID: test-agent-1752739865009
  UUID: 4d060bbd-4cb2-4f45-8dc0-63bd5a6e6e34
  Agent Wallet: 9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM
  ```

## 🗂️ File Structure Verification

The system correctly creates the following directory structure:

```
~/.ghostspeak/agents/
├── uuid-mapping.json              # UUID to agent ID mapping
└── {agent_id}/
    └── credentials.json           # Agent credentials and wallet info
```

**Example credentials.json structure:**
```json
{
  "agentId": "test-agent-1752739865009",
  "uuid": "4d060bbd-4cb2-4f45-8dc0-63bd5a6e6e34",
  "name": "Test Agent",
  "description": "A test agent for the new wallet system",
  "agentWallet": {
    "publicKey": "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM",
    "secretKey": [...]
  },
  "ownerWallet": "9WzDXwBbmkg8ZTbNMqUxvQRAyrZzDsGYdLVL9zYtAWWM",
  "createdAt": 1752739865009,
  "updatedAt": 1752739865009
}
```
