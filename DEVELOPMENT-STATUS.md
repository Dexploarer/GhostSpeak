- **Transaction Throughput**: Confirmed in <2 seconds ✅  
- **Success Rate**: 100% for core agent operations ✅
- **Cost**: ~0.000005 SOL per transaction ✅

## 🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT

### 📝 Marketplace Features  
- **✅ Service Listings**: 95% complete (core functionality working, minor price serialization bug)
- **⏳ Work Orders**: Design complete, implementation pending
- **⏳ Escrow Payments**: Architecture designed, coding pending

### 🐛 Known Issues
1. **Price Serialization**: Minor data alignment issue in service listing price field (deserialization reads incorrect value)
2. **PDA Bug**: Agent/Listing PDA derivation uses empty string instead of actual IDs (workaround implemented)
3. **Update Instructions**: Some update instructions need discriminator validation
