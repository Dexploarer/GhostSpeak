## 🛠️ Workarounds and Mitigation Strategies

### For High Compute Unit Requirements
```typescript
// Use batch operations to amortize costs
const batchConfig = BatchOperations.calculate_batch_config(
  single_operation_cost,
  accounts_per_operation,
  total_operations
);

// Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
const retryTransaction = async (operation: () => Promise<string>) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === 2) throw error;
      await sleep(Math.pow(2, i) * 1000);
    }
  }
};
```

### For SPL Token 2022 Compatibility
```typescript
// Check wallet SPL Token 2022 support before operations
const checkWalletCompatibility = async (wallet: Wallet) => {
  try {
    // Test SPL Token 2022 transaction capability
    await wallet.signTransaction(testTransaction);
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Wallet does not support SPL Token 2022');
    return false;
  }
};
```

### For Storage Cost Management
```typescript
// Optimize agent data structure
const optimizeAgentData = (agentData: AgentData) => {
  return {
    ...agentData,
    capabilities: agentData.capabilities.slice(0, MAX_CAPABILITIES_COUNT),
    description: agentData.description.slice(0, MAX_GENERAL_STRING_LENGTH)
  };
};
```

### For Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Use multiple faucet sources for reliability
npx ghostspeak faucet --source all --save
npx ghostspeak faucet status  # Check rate limits

# Set up local validator for development
solana-test-validator --reset --quiet &
solana config set --url localhost
```

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Transaction Throughput Limits

**Current Estimates:**
- Single agent registration: ~2.5 TPS (due to 40,000 CU limit)
- Payment processing: ~5 TPS (due to 25,000 CU limit)
- Simple operations: ~10-15 TPS

**Scaling Strategies:**
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple program instances
2. **State Partitioning**: Partition agent data across multiple accounts
3. **Batch Operations**: Group multiple operations into single transactions
4. **Compute Optimization**: Reduce CU consumption through optimization

### Data Storage Constraints

**Rent Economics:**
- Agent Account: ~0.02 SOL rent exemption
- Payment Account: ~0.01 SOL rent exemption
- Work Order: ~0.015 SOL rent exemption

**Storage Scaling:**
- Consider compressed NFTs for large data
- Implement data archival strategies
- Use external storage for non-critical data

### Network Limitations

**Solana Network Constraints:**
- Block time: ~400ms average
- Transaction size: 1232 bytes maximum
- Accounts per transaction: 64 maximum
- Network congestion during high usage
