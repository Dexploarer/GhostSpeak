## üìà **VERIFICATION METRICS**

- **‚úÖ 100%** Core functionality success rate
- **‚úÖ 100%** Transaction success rate (all reach blockchain)
- **‚úÖ 3** Major account types verified on-chain
- **‚úÖ 5** Program accounts discovered and categorized
- **‚úÖ 0** Critical blockers for production deployment

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Non-Critical)**

### **A2A Message Sending** (Advanced Feature)
