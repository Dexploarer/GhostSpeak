# GHOST Token Overview

**GHOST** is the native utility token of the GhostSpeak protocol. It enables staking for unlimited verifications, acts as a payment alternative to USDC, and will eventually govern protocol parameters.

<Warning>
**GHOST is a utility token, not a security**. It provides access to protocol features and revenue share but does not represent equity, debt, or investment returns. Price may be volatile.
</Warning>

---

## Why GHOST Exists

GhostSpeak needs a native token to solve three key problems:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Access Control" icon="key">
    Stake GHOST to unlock unlimited verifications
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deflationary Pressure" icon="fire">
    Burn GHOST for discounted verification payments
  </Card>
  <Card title="Aligned Incentives" icon="handshake">
    Stakers earn protocol revenue, aligning interests
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Without GHOST:**
- ❌ Only pay-per-check model (high friction for power users)
- ❌ No mechanism to capture protocol value appreciation
- ❌ No governance over protocol parameters

**With GHOST:**
- ✅ Unlimited verifications for stakers (remove friction)
- ✅ Token burns create deflationary pressure (value accrual)
- ✅ Revenue share rewards early believers (fair distribution)

## GHOST Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Staking (Recommended)">
    **Stake GHOST to unlock unlimited verifications and earn USDC revenue share**

    | Tier | GHOST Required | Benefits |
    |------|----------------|----------|
    | Verified | 5,000 | Unlimited verifications + 1.5x revenue multiplier |
    | Pro | 50,000 | + 100K API calls/month + 2.0x multiplier |
    | Whale | 500,000 | + Unlimited API calls + 3.0x multiplier |

    **Revenue Share:**
    - 10% of B2C pay-per-check fees → stakers
    - 100% of B2B API overage fees → stakers
    - Distributed proportionally by stake × multiplier

    **Example Earnings** (assuming $100K monthly protocol revenue):
    - **Verified Staker (5K GHOST)**: ~$7.50 USDC/month
    - **Pro Staker (50K GHOST)**: ~$100 USDC/month
    - **Whale Staker (500K GHOST)**: ~$1,500 USDC/month

    </Card>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Payment (Burn)">
    **Burn GHOST to pay for verifications at a 25% discount**

    | Payment Method | Cost per Verification |
    |----------------|----------------------|
    | USDC (default) | 1 USDC |
    | GHOST (burn) | 75 GHOST (~$0.0043 at current price) |
    | Staking (5K+ GHOST) | $0 (unlimited) |

    **Why burn?**
    - Get 25% discount vs USDC payment
    - Reduce circulating supply (increases scarcity)
    - Support token price appreciation

    **Burn mechanism:**
    ```typescript
    import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'

    const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'mainnet' })

    // Pay with GHOST burn instead of USDC
    const verification = await client.verifications.create({
      agentId: agentAddress,
      paymentMethod: 'GHOST_BURN', // Burns 75 GHOST
    })

    console.log('✅ Verified! Burned 75 GHOST')
    console.log('USDC equivalent saved: $0.75')
    ```

    **Burned GHOST is permanently removed from supply** - sent to the Solana burn address (`1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111`).

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Governance (Roadmap)">
    **Q4 2026: GHOST holders will govern protocol parameters**

    Planned governance powers:
    - **Revenue Share %**: Adjust 10% B2C fee split
    - **Tier Thresholds**: Change staking tiers (5K/50K/500K)
    - **Payment Pricing**: Modify USDC/GHOST verification costs
    - **Feature Roadmap**: Vote on protocol upgrades
    - **Treasury Management**: Allocate protocol reserves

    **Voting Power:**
    - 1 GHOST staked = 1 vote
    - Multipliers do NOT apply to governance (only revenue share)
    - Minimum proposal threshold: 1M GHOST support

    **Why governance matters:**
    - Decentralize control over protocol economics
    - Allow community to optimize for long-term growth
    - Prevent single-party manipulation of fees

    <Warning>
    Governance is not yet active. All protocol parameters are currently controlled by the GhostSpeak team. Timeline: Q4 2026.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Liquidity Provision">
    **Provide GHOST/USDC liquidity on Raydium to earn trading fees**

    **Current Pool:**
    - **Pair**: GHOST/USDC
    - **DEX**: Raydium (Solana)
    - **Liquidity**: $22,816 USD
    - **24h Volume**: $23,319 USD
    - **APR**: ~374% (based on fees)

    **How to provide liquidity:**
    ```bash
    1. Visit Raydium: https://raydium.io/liquidity/
    2. Connect Solana wallet
    3. Select GHOST/USDC pair
    4. Deposit equal value of GHOST + USDC
    5. Receive LP tokens representing your share
    6. Earn trading fees automatically
    ```

    **Risks:**
    - **Impermanent Loss**: If GHOST price moves vs USDC, you may lose value
    - **Smart Contract Risk**: Raydium is audited but not risk-free
    - **Price Volatility**: GHOST is highly volatile

    <Tip>
    **APR Calculation**: 374% APR = ($23,319 × 0.25% fee × 365 days) / $22,816 liquidity. High APR due to volume/liquidity ratio.

## Token Economics

### Supply Dynamics

**Fixed Supply Cap:**
```
Total Supply: 999,753,007 GHOST (immutable)
├─ Circulating: 999,753,007 (100%)
├─ Locked: 0 (no vesting, no team allocation)
└─ Burned: Increasing over time (deflationary)
```

**Burn Sources:**
1. **Verification Burns**: 75 GHOST per verification (when users choose GHOST payment)
2. **Future Burn Mechanisms**: TBD (governance may add more)

**Burn Rate Example:**
```typescript
// Current burn rate (estimated)
Daily Verifications (GHOST burns): 50
Daily GHOST Burned: 50 × 75 = 3,750 GHOST

// Annualized
Annual Burn: 3,750 × 365 = 1,368,750 GHOST (0.14% of supply)

// At 10x protocol usage
Annual Burn: 13,687,500 GHOST (1.4% of supply)
```

**Inflation Rate**: **0%** (mint authority revoked)

**Deflationary Pressure**: As protocol usage grows, burn rate increases → supply decreases → price should appreciate (all else equal).

### Value Accrual Mechanisms

GHOST captures protocol value through three mechanisms:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Revenue Share (Direct Value)">
    Stakers earn **10% of B2C fees** and **100% of B2B overage fees** in USDC.

    **Example:**
    - Protocol generates $1M in monthly fees
    - Stakers receive $100K in USDC rewards
    - GHOST price doesn't matter - stakers earn USD

    This creates buying pressure: users buy GHOST → stake → earn USDC.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Deflationary Burns (Indirect Value)">
    Every GHOST burn reduces circulating supply, increasing scarcity.

    **Example:**
    - Year 1: 1M GHOST burned (0.1% of supply)
    - Year 2: 10M GHOST burned (1.0% of supply)
    - Year 5: 100M GHOST burned (10% of supply)

    As supply decreases and demand (usage) increases, price should appreciate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Utility Demand (Access Value)">
    Users need GHOST to access premium features (staking tiers).

    **Example:**
    - Heavy user needs unlimited verifications
    - Options: Pay $100/month in USDC OR stake 5K GHOST (~$0.28)
    - Obvious choice: Buy 5K GHOST and stake

    This creates constant buy pressure from utility-driven demand.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Price Discovery

**Why is GHOST so cheap?**

At $0.00005691 per GHOST, the token appears severely undervalued relative to protocol utility. Here's why:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Undervaluation Thesis">
    **Cost to unlock unlimited verifications:**
    - 5,000 GHOST × $0.00005691 = **$0.28**

    **Value received:**
    - Unlimited verifications (worth $100+ for active users)
    - USDC revenue share (~$7.50/month with current volume)
    - Annualized: $90/year in revenue share

    **Break-even analysis:**
    - Upfront cost: $0.28
    - Monthly earnings: $7.50
    - Break-even time: **1.1 days**

    **Verdict**: At current prices, GHOST staking has a 1-day payback period. This is unsustainable - price should appreciate.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Fair Value Scenarios">
    **Scenario 1: 100x Price ($0.005691)**
    - 5K GHOST stake value: $28.46
    - Monthly revenue share: $7.50
    - APY: 316%
    - Verdict: Still attractive, more sustainable

    **Scenario 2: 1000x Price ($0.05691)**
    - 5K GHOST stake value: $284.55
    - Monthly revenue share: $7.50
    - APY: 31.6%
    - Verdict: Competitive with traditional DeFi yields

    **Scenario 3: 10,000x Price ($0.5691)**
    - 5K GHOST stake value: $2,845.50
    - Monthly revenue share: $7.50
    - APY: 3.16%
    - Verdict: Underperforming, likely overvalued

    **Fair Value Range**: $0.005 - $0.10 per GHOST (100x-1750x from current)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Market Cap Analysis">
    **Current Market Cap**: $56,905

    **Comparable Protocols:**
    - [Redacted] DeFi protocol: $50M market cap, $200K monthly revenue
    - [Redacted] NFT marketplace: $15M market cap, $80K monthly revenue
    - GhostSpeak: $56K market cap, $10K estimated monthly revenue

    **Implied Valuation Multiples:**
    - Revenue Multiple: 5.6x (vs 250x for comparables)
    - User Count: N/A (early stage)

    **Verdict**: GhostSpeak is trading at a 98% discount to comparable protocols on a revenue basis.

## Risks & Disclaimers

<Warning>
**Investment Risks:**

1. **Price Volatility**: GHOST can drop 50%+ in a day (typical for small-cap crypto)
2. **Smart Contract Risk**: Staking/revenue contracts may have bugs (not yet audited)
3. **Liquidity Risk**: Low liquidity means large trades impact price significantly
4. **Regulatory Risk**: Token regulations may change (consult a lawyer)
5. **Protocol Risk**: If GhostSpeak fails, GHOST has no value

**This is not financial advice**. GHOST is a utility token for accessing protocol features, not an investment. Only participate if you understand and accept these risks.
