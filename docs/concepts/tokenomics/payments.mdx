## Quick Comparison

| Payment Method | Cost per Verification | Upfront Cost | Best For | Revenue Share |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **USDC** | 1 USDC | $0 | 1-10 verifications | None |
| **GHOST Burn** | 75 GHOST (~$0.0043) | $0 | 10-100 verifications | None |
| **GHOST Staking** | $0 (unlimited) | 5K GHOST (~$0.28) | 100+ verifications | 10% B2C + 100% B2B overage |

**Verdict at current prices** ($0.00005691/GHOST):
- **1-10 verifications**: Use USDC (simplest)
- **10-100 verifications**: Use GHOST burn (25% discount)
- **100+ verifications**: Stake GHOST (unlimited + revenue share)

---

## Option 1: USDC Pay-Per-Check

**Pay 1 USDC per verification** - the default, no-commitment option.

### How It Works

```
User requests verification
        │
        ▼
GhostSpeak checks USDC balance
        │
        ▼
Deduct 1 USDC from wallet
        │
        ▼
Perform verification
        │
        ▼
Return results
```

### Pricing

| Quantity | Total Cost (USDC) | Cost per Verification |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | $1 | $1.00 |
| 10 | $10 | $1.00 |
| 100 | $100 | $1.00 |
| 1,000 | $1,000 | $1.00 |

**No volume discounts** for USDC payment.

### Code Example

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'

const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'mainnet' })

// Pay with USDC (default)
const verification = await client.verifications.create({
  agentId: agentAddress,
  paymentMethod: 'USDC', // Explicitly specify USDC
})

console.log('✅ Verified! Cost: 1 USDC')
console.log('Verification ID:', verification.id)
console.log('Ghost Score:', verification.ghostScore)
```

### Pros & Cons

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pros">
    ✅ **No upfront cost** - pay only when you verify
    ✅ **Stable pricing** - USDC is pegged to $1 USD
    ✅ **No token management** - don't need to buy/hold GHOST
    ✅ **Predictable budget** - 1 verification = $1, simple math
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cons">
    ❌ **No discounts** - pay full price every time
    ❌ **No revenue share** - don't earn from protocol growth
    ❌ **Expensive at scale** - 1000 verifications = $1000
    ❌ **Missed opportunity** - don't benefit from GHOST price appreciation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best For

- **Casual users** verifying &lt;10 agents per month
- **New users** testing GhostSpeak without commitment
- **USDC holders** who don't want token exposure
- **Price-sensitive** users who value stable pricing

---

## Option 2: GHOST Burn

**Burn 75 GHOST per verification** - get a 25% discount vs USDC.

### How It Works

```
User requests verification
        │
        ▼
GhostSpeak checks GHOST balance
        │
        ▼
Burn 75 GHOST (send to burn address)
        │
        ▼
Perform verification
        │
        ▼
Return results
```

**Burned GHOST is permanently removed from circulation** - sent to Solana's burn address (`1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111`).

### Pricing

| Quantity | Total Cost (GHOST) | USDC Equivalent | Savings vs USDC |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 75 GHOST | $0.0043 | $0.9957 (99.6%) |
| 10 | 750 GHOST | $0.043 | $9.957 (99.6%) |
| 100 | 7,500 GHOST | $0.43 | $99.57 (99.6%) |
| 1,000 | 75,000 GHOST | $4.27 | $995.73 (99.6%) |

**At current price** ($0.00005691/GHOST):
- GHOST burn = $0.0043 per verification
- USDC payment = $1.00 per verification
- **Savings: 99.6%** (due to extremely low GHOST price)

<Warning>
**Price Volatility**: GHOST burn cost fluctuates with token price. If GHOST appreciates 100x, burn cost becomes $0.43/verification (still 57% cheaper than USDC).

At GHOST = $0.01333/token, burn cost equals USDC cost (1 USDC = 75 GHOST).
</Warning>

### Code Example

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'

const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'mainnet' })

// Pay with GHOST burn
const verification = await client.verifications.create({
  agentId: agentAddress,
  paymentMethod: 'GHOST_BURN', // Burns 75 GHOST
})

console.log('✅ Verified! Burned 75 GHOST')
console.log('USDC equivalent saved:', 1 - (75 * 0.00005691))
console.log('Verification ID:', verification.id)

// Check burn transaction
console.log('Burn TX:', verification.burnSignature)
// Verify on Solscan: https://solscan.io/tx/{burnSignature}
```

### Batch Burn (Recommended)

```typescript
// Verify multiple agents with GHOST burn
const agents = [agent1, agent2, agent3, /* ... 100 agents */]

const results = await client.verifications.batchCreate({
  agentIds: agents.map(a => a.address),
  paymentMethod: 'GHOST_BURN',
})

console.log(`✅ Verified ${results.length} agents`)
console.log(`Burned ${results.length * 75} GHOST total`)
console.log(`USDC equivalent saved: $${results.length - (results.length * 75 * 0.00005691)}`)
```

### Pros & Cons

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pros">
    ✅ **25% discount** - designed to be cheaper than USDC (at parity pricing)
    ✅ **99.6% savings** at current GHOST price ($0.00005691)
    ✅ **Deflationary** - burns reduce supply, supporting price
    ✅ **No commitment** - pay-as-you-go like USDC
    ✅ **Tax efficiency** - burning may be tax-deductible (consult accountant)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cons">
    ❌ **Volatile pricing** - cost changes with GHOST price
    ❌ **No revenue share** - don't earn from protocol growth
    ❌ **Token management** - need to buy and hold GHOST
    ❌ **Irreversible** - burned GHOST can't be recovered
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best For

- **Medium-volume users** verifying 10-100 agents per month
- **GHOST believers** who want to support token price
- **Discount seekers** maximizing savings vs USDC
- **Tax optimizers** (burning may offset gains)

---

## Option 3: GHOST Staking

**Stake 5,000+ GHOST** for unlimited verifications + USDC revenue share.

### How It Works

```
User stakes GHOST tokens
        │
        ▼
Unlock unlimited verifications
        │
        ▼
Verify as many agents as needed ($0/verification)
        │
        ▼
Earn USDC revenue share daily
        │
        ▼
Claim rewards anytime
        │
        ▼
Unstake to exit (keep all rewards)
```

### Staking Tiers

| Tier | GHOST Required | Cost at $0.00005691 | Benefits | Revenue Multiplier |
|------|----------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Verified** | 5,000 | $0.28 | Unlimited verifications | 1.5x |
| **Pro** | 50,000 | $2.85 | + 100K API calls/month | 2.0x |
| **Whale** | 500,000 | $28.46 | + Unlimited API calls | 3.0x |

### Pricing

**Upfront Cost:**
- Verified: 5,000 GHOST × $0.00005691 = **$0.28**
- Pro: 50,000 GHOST × $0.00005691 = **$2.85**
- Whale: 500,000 GHOST × $0.00005691 = **$28.46**

**Cost per Verification:**
- All tiers: **$0** (unlimited)

**Revenue Share (USDC):**

Assuming $10K monthly rewards pool, 10M effective stake total:

| Tier | Your Effective Stake | Pool Share | Monthly Earnings | Annualized |
|------|---------------------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Verified | 7,500 (5K × 1.5x) | 0.075% | $7.50 | $90 |
| Pro | 100,000 (50K × 2.0x) | 1.0% | $100 | $1,200 |
| Whale | 1,500,000 (500K × 3.0x) | 15.0% | $1,500 | $18,000 |

### Code Example

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'

const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'mainnet' })

// Stake 5K GHOST (Verified tier)
const stake = await client.staking.stake({
  amount: 5_000_000_000n, // 5K GHOST (6 decimals)
})

console.log('✅ Staked successfully!')
console.log('Tier:', stake.tier) // "Verified Staker"
console.log('Revenue Multiplier:', stake.multiplier) // 1.5x

// Verify agents (unlimited, $0 cost)
const verification1 = await client.verifications.create({ agentId: agent1 })
const verification2 = await client.verifications.create({ agentId: agent2 })
const verification3 = await client.verifications.create({ agentId: agent3 })
// ... verify 1000 more agents for $0 ...

// Check pending rewards
const rewards = await client.staking.getRewards()
console.log('Pending USDC:', rewards.pending)
console.log('Estimated monthly:', rewards.estimatedMonthly)
console.log('Estimated APY:', `${rewards.estimatedAPY}%`)

// Claim rewards
const claim = await client.staking.claimRewards()
console.log('✅ Claimed', claim.usdcAmount, 'USDC')
```

### Pros & Cons

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pros">
    ✅ **Unlimited verifications** - no per-check cost
    ✅ **USDC revenue share** - earn 10% B2C + 100% B2B overage fees
    ✅ **High APY** - 32,000%+ at current GHOST price (normalizes as price rises)
    ✅ **No lockup** - unstake anytime, keep rewards
    ✅ **Price upside** - benefit from GHOST appreciation
    ✅ **Multiplier bonuses** - higher tiers earn more per GHOST staked
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cons">
    ❌ **Upfront capital** - need to buy 5K+ GHOST
    ❌ **Price risk** - GHOST may depreciate while staked
    ❌ **Variable APY** - earnings depend on protocol revenue
    ❌ **Smart contract risk** - staking contract may have bugs
    ❌ **Opportunity cost** - GHOST locked in staking can't be traded
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best For

- **Power users** verifying 100+ agents per month
- **Long-term holders** bullish on GhostSpeak growth
- **Revenue seekers** wanting USDC passive income
- **Early adopters** maximizing APY while GHOST is cheap

## Break-Even Analysis

**At what verification count does each option become optimal?**

### Current Prices ($0.00005691/GHOST)

```typescript
// Assumptions
const USDC_COST = 1.00                    // $1 per verification
const GHOST_BURN_COST = 75 * 0.00005691   // $0.0043 per verification
const VERIFIED_STAKE_COST = 5000 * 0.00005691  // $0.28 upfront

// Break-even calculations
const breakEvenBurnVsUSDC = VERIFIED_STAKE_COST / (USDC_COST - GHOST_BURN_COST)
// = $0.28 / ($1.00 - $0.0043) = 0.28 verifications

const breakEvenStakingVsUSDC = VERIFIED_STAKE_COST / USDC_COST
// = $0.28 / $1.00 = 0.28 verifications

const breakEvenStakingVsBurn = VERIFIED_STAKE_COST / GHOST_BURN_COST
// = $0.28 / $0.0043 = 65 verifications
```

**Results:**
- **USDC vs GHOST Burn**: Burn is cheaper after just **1 verification** (at current prices)
- **USDC vs Staking**: Staking is cheaper after just **1 verification** (at current prices)
- **GHOST Burn vs Staking**: Staking is cheaper after **65 verifications**

<Warning>
**These break-even numbers assume current GHOST price**. If GHOST appreciates 100x:
- USDC = $1/verification (unchanged)
- GHOST Burn = $0.43/verification (75 GHOST × $0.005691)
- Staking upfront = $28.46 (5K GHOST × $0.005691)

New break-evens:
- Staking vs USDC: 28 verifications
- Staking vs Burn: 66 verifications (nearly identical)
</Warning>

### Realistic Pricing Scenario ($0.01333/GHOST = Parity)

**If GHOST reaches $0.01333** (234x from current):
- USDC = $1/verification
- GHOST Burn = $1/verification (75 × $0.01333 = 25% discount no longer applies due to pricing)
- Staking upfront = $66.65 (5K × $0.01333)

Break-evens:
- **Staking vs USDC**: 67 verifications
- **Staking vs Burn**: 67 verifications

**Conclusion**: At parity pricing, staking breaks even around **60-70 verifications**.

## Total Cost Comparison

**How much do you spend at different usage levels?**

| Verifications | USDC Cost | GHOST Burn Cost* | Staking Cost** | Best Option |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | $1 | $0.0043 | $0.28 | GHOST Burn |
| 10 | $10 | $0.043 | $0.28 | Staking |
| 100 | $100 | $0.43 | $0.28 | Staking |
| 1,000 | $1,000 | $4.27 | $0.28 | Staking |
| 10,000 | $10,000 | $42.68 | $0.28 | Staking |

*At $0.00005691/GHOST
**Verified tier (5K GHOST), not including revenue share earnings

**With revenue share** (assuming $7.50/month):
- **10 verifications**: Staking cost = $0.28 - $7.50 = -$7.22 (you're paid to verify!)
- **100 verifications**: Staking cost = $0.28 - $7.50 = -$7.22 (still profitable)
- **1,000 verifications**: Staking cost = $0.28 - $7.50 = -$7.22 (maximize earnings)

<Tip>
**At current prices, staking is profitable after just 1 day** due to revenue share exceeding upfront stake cost.
</Tip>

**Staking:**
- Upfront: 5K × $0.00005691 = **$0.28**
- Monthly revenue share: **$7.50**
- Annual profit: $90 - $0.28 = **$89.72**

**Best Option**: **Staking** ($89.72 profit vs $10 cost for USDC)

---

### Example 2: Power User (1,000 verifications/month)

**USDC:**
- Monthly cost: 1,000 × $1 = **$1,000**
- Annual cost: $12,000

**GHOST Burn:**
- Monthly cost: 1,000 × 75 × $0.00005691 = **$4.27**
- Annual cost: $51.24

**Staking:**
- Upfront: 5K × $0.00005691 = **$0.28**
- Monthly revenue share: **$7.50**
- Annual profit: $90 - $0.28 = **$89.72**

**Best Option**: **Staking** ($89.72 profit vs $1,000 cost for USDC)

Even GHOST burn ($51.24/year) is 99.6% cheaper than USDC ($12,000/year).

---

### Example 3: Enterprise (100K verifications/month)

**USDC:**
- Monthly cost: 100,000 × $1 = **$100,000**
- Annual cost: $1,200,000

**GHOST Burn:**
- Monthly cost: 100,000 × 75 × $0.00005691 = **$427.35**
- Annual cost: $5,128.20

**Staking (Pro Tier):**
- Upfront: 50K × $0.00005691 = **$2.85**
- Monthly revenue share: **$100**
- Annual profit: $1,200 - $2.85 = **$1,197.15**

**Best Option**: **Staking Pro Tier** ($1,197 profit vs $100K cost for USDC)

GHOST burn is also viable ($5,128/year vs $1.2M/year).

## Decision Tree

Use this flowchart to pick the right payment option:

```
Start: How many verifications do you need?
    │
    ├─ 1-10 verifications
    │   └─> Are you bullish on GHOST price?
    │       ├─ Yes → GHOST Burn (99.6% savings + deflationary support)
    │       └─ No → USDC (simple, stable pricing)
    │
    ├─ 10-100 verifications

## Payment Method Migration

**Can you switch payment methods later?**

Yes! You can change payment methods at any time:

```typescript
// Switch from USDC to GHOST burn
const verification = await client.verifications.create({
  agentId: agentAddress,
  paymentMethod: 'GHOST_BURN', // Changed from default USDC
})

// Switch to staking (stake GHOST first)
await client.staking.stake({ amount: 5_000_000_000n })

// Now all verifications are free (unlimited)
const verification2 = await client.verifications.create({
  agentId: agentAddress,
  // No paymentMethod needed - staking automatically used
})

// Unstake anytime to revert to pay-per-check
await client.staking.unstake({ amount: 'all' })
```

**No penalties for switching** - choose the optimal method at any time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is GHOST burn cheaper than USDC?">
    By design, GHOST burn is **25% cheaper** than USDC at parity pricing ($0.01333/GHOST).

    Formula: `USDC_COST = GHOST_BURN_COST × 1.33`

    At current prices ($0.00005691), GHOST is **99.6% cheaper** due to severe undervaluation.

    As GHOST appreciates, the discount normalizes to the designed 25%.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to burned GHOST?">
    Burned GHOST is sent to Solana's official burn address: `1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111`

    This address has no private key - tokens sent there are **permanently removed** from circulation.

    You can verify burns on [Solscan](https://solscan.io/account/1nc1nerator11111111111111111111111111111111).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I unstake without penalty?">
    Yes! **No lockup period** for staking.

    You can unstake anytime and receive your GHOST back immediately. You keep all claimed rewards but stop earning new revenue share.

    Unstaking does NOT penalize you - you just lose future unlimited verifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which payment method is best for taxes?">
    **This is not tax advice** (consult a tax professional), but general considerations:

    - **USDC**: Simple business expense deduction
    - **GHOST Burn**: May offset capital gains (burning = disposal event)
    - **Staking**: Revenue share is taxable income, unstaking may trigger capital gains

    Most tax-efficient option depends on your jurisdiction and tax situation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I combine payment methods?">
    Yes! You can use different methods for different verifications:

    ```typescript
    // Verify agent 1 with USDC
    await client.verifications.create({
      agentId: agent1,
      paymentMethod: 'USDC'
    })

    // Verify agent 2 with GHOST burn
    await client.verifications.create({
      agentId: agent2,
      paymentMethod: 'GHOST_BURN'
    })

    // Stake GHOST for unlimited verifications going forward
    await client.staking.stake({ amount: 5_000_000_000n })

    // All future verifications are free
    await client.verifications.create({ agentId: agent3 })
    ```

    Mix and match as needed!

<Tip>
**Current Recommendation**: At $0.00005691/GHOST, staking is the clear winner for any usage level >1 verification. The upfront cost ($0.28) is recovered in revenue share within 1 day.

If you verify even 1 agent per month, staking is more profitable than USDC payment.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Price Volatility**: GHOST price can change dramatically. These comparisons assume current pricing and may not reflect future costs. Always verify current prices before committing.
</Warning>
