# API Keys

Create, list, and revoke API keys from the dashboard page at `https://ghostspeak.io/dashboard/api-keys`.

This page documents the current dashboard implementation in [`packages/web/app/dashboard/api-keys/page.tsx`](packages/web/app/dashboard/api-keys/page.tsx:1).

## Managing keys (dashboard)

- Keys are **created** and **revoked** via the dashboard UI.
- When you create a key, the **plaintext API key is revealed once** (in a one-time reveal dialog). After you dismiss it, it cannot be shown again.
- After creation, the dashboard only stores/displays a **non-secret prefix** (`keyPrefix`) so you can identify a key later.

<Warning>
Treat your API key like a password. If you lose it (or suspect it’s been exposed), revoke it and create a new one.
</Warning>

## Using your API key

Send the key using the recommended header contract:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>
```

Example (consistent with the dashboard “Usage” card):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>" \
  https://api.ghostspeak.io/...
```

The dashboard UI also notes that `X-API-Key` is accepted as an alias for compatibility (see [`packages/web/app/dashboard/api-keys/page.tsx`](packages/web/app/dashboard/api-keys/page.tsx:190)).

## Developer notes (Convex)

API key management is implemented in Convex:

- Functions live in [`packages/web/convex/apiKeys.ts`](packages/web/convex/apiKeys.ts:1):
  - [`listMyApiKeys()`](packages/web/convex/apiKeys.ts:31) (list keys with safe fields only)
  - [`createApiKey()`](packages/web/convex/apiKeys.ts:66) (returns the plaintext key once)
  - [`revokeApiKey()`](packages/web/convex/apiKeys.ts:127)
  - [`verifyApiKey()`](packages/web/convex/apiKeys.ts:156) (internal helper that hashes + checks `isActive` and updates `lastUsedAt`)
- Helpers live in [`packages/web/convex/apiKeyHelpers.ts`](packages/web/convex/apiKeyHelpers.ts:1):
  - [`generateApiKeyMaterial()`](packages/web/convex/apiKeyHelpers.ts:263)
  - [`sha256Hex()`](packages/web/convex/apiKeyHelpers.ts:248)
