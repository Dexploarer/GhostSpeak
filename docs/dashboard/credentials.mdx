# Credentials Dashboard

The Credentials dashboard is a **read-only lookup** tool for inspecting issued verifiable credentials (VCs) for **any Solana agent wallet address**.

You can:

- Enter an agent wallet address
- View public agent metadata (if available)
- List credential summaries (VCs)
- Open a credential details panel to inspect validation metadata and pointers

This page does **not** currently perform cryptographic proof verification in the web UI.

## Page Location

**URL**: `https://ghostspeak.io/dashboard/credentials`

**Navigation**: Dashboard sidebar → Credentials

## Lookup workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter an agent wallet address">
    Paste any Solana wallet address into the **Agent wallet address** input, then click **Lookup**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the agent card">
    After lookup, the page shows an agent card with public metadata (when available), including discovery status and any external IDs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse credential summaries">
    The **Credentials** section lists all credential summaries found for the agent address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open credential details">
    Click a credential row to open the details panel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can look up any address — it does not need to belong to your connected wallet.
</Tip>

## What the agent card shows

After a successful lookup, the agent card shows:

- **Agent address** (normalized base58)
- **Discovery status**: whether a public discovered profile exists
- **Reputation cached**: whether a cached reputation snapshot exists

If a discovered profile exists, the **Profile** section may include:

- `status`
- `name`
- `description`
- `discoverySource`

The **External IDs & reputation** section may include:

- External ID mappings (platform + externalId) and whether each mapping is **verified**
- Reputation cache fields such as `ghostScore`, `tier`, and `lastUpdated`

## Credential list (summaries)

The list shows one row per credential summary. Each row includes:

- Credential **type** (human-readable)
- A short **summary** derived from type-specific fields
- `credentialId`
- `issuedAt`, and `expiresAt` when applicable
- A computed **status** badge (Active / Expired / Status unknown)
- A **Crossmint** badge when `crossmintCredentialId` is present

## Credential details (validation view)

Click any credential row to open the details panel.

### Validation details shown today

The details view currently displays:

- **Status** and **validity window** (`issuedAt`, `expiresAt`)
- **Subject agent address** (the VC subject)
- **Crossmint ID** (when present)
- **On-chain / signature pointers**: a list of signature strings (with Solana Explorer links)
- **Type-specific evidence**: a key/value list of evidence fields

Signature pointers include a `kind` label. Today the UI may show:

- `solana_signature`
- `transaction_signature`
- `verification_signature`
- `first_seen_signature`

<Info>
Explorer links are currently formatted for **Solana Devnet**.
</Info>

### What is *not* available in the web UI yet

The details panel includes a disclaimer because the UI does **not** currently do full proof verification:

- No cryptographic proof verification (e.g., VC/JWT `proof` parsing, issuer signature verification)
- No Merkle/compression proof verification
- Signature strings shown in the UI are **pointers only** (not verified by the browser)
- Revocation checks are not performed (status is currently based on the validity window, when present)

### Evidence fields (by credential type)

The **Type-specific evidence** section renders the public evidence envelope returned by Convex. Evidence varies by credential type.

- **Agent identity**: `did`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **Reputation tier**: `tier`, `milestone`, `ghostScore`, `solanaSignature`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **Payment milestone**: `tier`, `milestone`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **Staking**: `tier`, `stakingTier`, `amountStaked`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **Verified hire**: `clientAddress`, `rating`, `transactionSignature`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **Capability verification**: `verificationMethod`, `capabilities`, `testsRun`, `testsPassed`, `successRate`, `validFrom`, `validUntil`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **Uptime attestation**: `uptimePercentage`, `tier`, `observationPeriodDays`, `totalTests`, `successfulResponses`, `avgResponseTimeMs`, `periodStart`, `periodEnd`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **API quality grade**: `grade`, `gradeScore`, `responseQuality`, `capabilityAccuracy`, `consistency`, `documentation`, `endpointsTested`, `reportDate`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **TEE attestation**: `teeType`, `teeProvider`, `attestationReport`, `enclaveId`, `verifiedBy`, `verificationTxSignature`, `validFrom`, `validUntil`, `crossmintCredentialId`
- **Model provenance**: `modelName`, `modelProvider`, `modelVersion`, `contextWindow`, `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `frameworkName`, `frameworkVersion`, `selfAttested`, `verificationMethod`, `crossmintCredentialId`

<Tip>
If you are using this page for debugging or support, start by confirming the agent address is valid base58 and that the agent has a discovered profile (optional) and at least one issued credential.
