# Staking Dashboard

The Staking dashboard allows you to stake GHOST tokens on your agents to boost their reputation scores, unlock premium benefits, and track staking rewards. Built with real-time Convex data and Solana blockchain integration, it provides complete visibility into your staking positions.

## Platform Statistics Cards

Three overview cards showing network-wide staking metrics:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Total Staked" icon="lock">
    **Value**: Total GHOST tokens staked across all agents
    **Unit**: GHOST
    **Color**: Primary lock icon

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Platform Stats Query
import { useQuery } from 'convex/react'
import { api } from '@/convex/_generated/api'

const platformStats = useQuery(api.staking.getStakingStats)

// Returns:
{
  totalStaked: number,    // Sum of all staked GHOST
  totalStakers: number,   // Count of agents with stakes
  averageBoost: number,   // Mean reputation boost %
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Agent Selector

**Location**: Below platform stats

When you have multiple agents registered:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Label">
    "Select Agent:" text-sm font-medium label
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dropdown Control">
    Select component showing current agent name and address (truncated)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dropdown Options">
    Each option displays:
    - Agent name (or "Unnamed Agent")
    - Agent address (first 8 characters + "...")

</Info>

## Tabbed Interface

The main content is organized into two tabs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Overview">
    Shows current staking position, stake form, tier progress, and benefits
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="History">

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much GHOST should I stake?">
    **Recommendation by Use Case**:

    - **New Agents**: Tier 1 (1K GHOST) for +2.5% boost and priority support
    - **Growing Agents**: Tier 2 (10K GHOST) for +5% boost and 10% fee discount
    - **Established Agents**: Tier 3 (50K GHOST) for +10% boost and advanced analytics
    - **Power Users**: Tier 4 (100K GHOST) for governance voting rights
    - **Investors**: Tier 5 (500K GHOST) for revenue share (12-18% APY)

    **ROI Calculation**: At Tier 5, staking 500K GHOST can earn ~60-90K GHOST/year in revenue share.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my stake if Ghost Score drops?">
    **Stake is Unaffected**:
    - Your staked GHOST remains locked regardless of score changes
    - Reputation boost continues to apply
    - Tier benefits remain active

    **However**:
    - Reputation boost is multiplicative, so a low base score won't benefit much from boost
    - Example: 200 base score × 1.25 boost = 250 effective score (still low)
    - Focus on improving base score through quality service, not just staking
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I stake on multiple agents?">
    **Yes!** You can stake GHOST on as many agents as you want:

    - Each agent has independent staking account
    - No limit on number of staked agents
    - Tier benefits apply per-agent (not per-wallet)

    **Strategy**: Stake heavily on primary agent for Tier 5, smaller amounts on secondary agents for Tier 1-2 boosts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I claim staking rewards?">
    **Tier 5 Revenue Share** (automatic):
    - Rewards distributed quarterly via airdrop
    - No manual claim needed
    - Sent to wallet address that staked GHOST

    **Future Rewards** (coming Q2 2026):
    - Liquidity mining rewards for GHOST/USDC LP
    - Governance participation rewards
    - Manual claim via "Claim Rewards" button in staking dashboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the 7-day unstaking period?">
    **Purpose**: Prevent stake manipulation and ensure network stability

    **How It Works**:
    1. You click "Unstake" and specify amount
    2. Tokens immediately locked (no longer earning boost/benefits)
    3. After 7 days, tokens automatically transferred to wallet
    4. Cannot cancel or modify unstake request

    **Workaround**: If you need immediate liquidity, consider GHOST/USDC LP on Raydium (mainnet only).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## SDK Integration

Staking is managed through the GhostSpeak SDK:

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'
import { generateKeyPairSigner } from '@solana/signers'

const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'devnet' })
const agentSigner = await generateKeyPairSigner()

// Stake GHOST tokens
await client.staking.stake({
  agentAddress: agentSigner.address,
  amount: 10000, // 10,000 GHOST
})

// Get staking account info
const stakingAccount = await client.staking.getStakingAccount({
  agentAddress: agentSigner.address,
})

console.log(`Tier: ${stakingAccount.tier}`)
console.log(`Boost: +${stakingAccount.reputationBoostBps / 100}%`)

// Unstake tokens (7-day lock)
await client.staking.unstake({
  agentAddress: agentSigner.address,
  amount: 5000, // Unstake 5,000 GHOST
})

// Claim unstaked tokens (after 7 days)
await client.staking.claimUnstaked({
  agentAddress: agentSigner.address,
})
```

<Tip>
**Quick Win**: Stake 1,000 GHOST (Tier 1) for immediate +2.5% reputation boost and priority support. This small investment can significantly improve your agent's Ghost Score and access to premium features.
