# Verified session dashboard

The `/dashboard` landing page is intentionally **minimalist** — but it’s also **session-gated**.

In dashboard docs, a **verified session** means:

- a **connected wallet**, **and**
- an active **SIWS (Sign-In With Solana)** session for that wallet.

In other words: “verified” here refers to the **user session state**, not whether features are “tested-only” or “stable-only.”

This gating is enforced in the dashboard page ([`packages/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`](packages/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx:1)) using the helper [`isVerifiedSessionForWallet()`](packages/web/lib/auth/verifiedSession.ts:43), and communicated in the “Verification Contract” panel [`VerificationContractCard`](packages/web/components/dashboard/VerificationContractCard.tsx:1).

## What “verified session” means

“Verified session dashboard” means:

- You can reach `/dashboard`, but **most dashboard UI remains locked** until SIWS authentication has completed.
- The wallet must be connected, and the SIWS session must match the connected wallet address.

The UI explicitly communicates this contract in [`VerificationContractCard`](packages/web/components/dashboard/VerificationContractCard.tsx:1).

## Why the landing page is minimalist

After a verified session is present, the dashboard still uses a small set of entrypoints. This is **by design**:

- Keep the hub focused on core onboarding loops.
- Avoid “coming soon” shortcuts on the landing page.
- Avoid duplicating the full sidebar/navigation sitemap.

This does **not** imply other features are untested; it’s a UX choice about what `/dashboard` should be.

The compact entrypoints are rendered by [`VerifiedActionBar`](packages/web/components/dashboard/VerifiedActionBar.tsx:1):

- **Chat** → `/caisper` (primary product entrypoint)
- **Register Agent** → `/agents/register` (developer onboarding entrypoint)
- **Settings** → `/settings` (account/profile entrypoint)
- **Observe** → `/dashboard/observe` (optional; controlled by `showObserveLink` in [`VerificationContractCard`](packages/web/components/dashboard/VerificationContractCard.tsx:8))

## What is intentionally not surfaced on the hub

The `/dashboard` hub intentionally does **not** surface CTAs for:

- **Payments / “Manage Payments”**
- **Staking / “Stake GHOST”**
- **Agent verification flows** (e.g. “Verify an Agent”, “Verify First Agent”)

Rationale (hub-only): keep `/dashboard` focused and predictable. Roadmap and ongoing work is tracked elsewhere (for example [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md:1) and [`docs/resources/community.mdx`](docs/resources/community.mdx:1)).

## How the verified-session gate is enforced

The gate is enforced as UI + tests:

1) **Session check in the dashboard page**
   - `/dashboard` computes `hasVerifiedSession` using [`isVerifiedSessionForWallet()`](packages/web/lib/auth/verifiedSession.ts:43) and only renders the full dashboard UI when it is true (see the “Session gating” branch in [`packages/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`](packages/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx:222)).

2) **Navigation “dashboard context” is explicit**
   - The header/nav switches into dashboard context for a small, explicit set of routes via [`isDashboardPage`](packages/web/components/layout/Navigation.tsx:41). This keeps `/caisper`, `/settings`, and `/agents/register` treated as authenticated/dashboard-adjacent pages.

3) **End-to-end invariant test**
   - The Playwright spec [`packages/web/e2e/dashboard-verified-only.spec.ts`](packages/web/e2e/dashboard-verified-only.spec.ts:1) asserts session-gated UI invariants for `/dashboard` (expected links, removed CTAs, and the presence of the verified-session contract panel).

## Developer notes

### Where the session check lives

- Session parsing + wallet match: [`readGhostSpeakAuthSessionFromLocalStorage()`](packages/web/lib/auth/verifiedSession.ts:14) and [`isVerifiedSessionForWallet()`](packages/web/lib/auth/verifiedSession.ts:43)
- Dashboard gate and “locked” state UI: [`packages/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`](packages/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx:171)

### Updating the contract list / surfaced actions

- **Contract panel list** (copy + action list): [`VerificationContractCard`](packages/web/components/dashboard/VerificationContractCard.tsx:1)
- **Action bar buttons** (primary CTA layout): [`VerifiedActionBar`](packages/web/components/dashboard/VerifiedActionBar.tsx:1)
- **Dashboard composition** (what the hub renders): [`packages/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`](packages/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx:430)

When updating the list, keep the **contract panel** and the **action bar** aligned.

### Running the Playwright spec

From the repo root:

```bash
bun run test:e2e -- e2e/dashboard-verified-only.spec.ts
```

Or from within `packages/web`:

```bash
bun run test:e2e e2e/dashboard-verified-only.spec.ts
```

Note: the spec seeds a Convex user via `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` (see [`getConvexUrlFromDotenv()`](packages/web/e2e/dashboard-verified-only.spec.ts:7)).
