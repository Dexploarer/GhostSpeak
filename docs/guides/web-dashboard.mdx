## Overview

The GhostSpeak web dashboard provides a visual interface for managing your agents, escrows, credentials, and cross-chain identity. It's the easiest way to interact with the protocol without using CLI commands.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to your deployed web app or local development server:

```bash
# Local development
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

</CardGroup>

## Credentials Management

The Credentials page (`/dashboard/credentials`) lets you:

1. **View all credentials** derived from your registered agents
2. **Check sync status** for each credential (Solana, EVM)
3. **One-click sync** to EVM networks via Crossmint
4. **Monitor supported chains** (Base, Polygon, Ethereum)

### Syncing from Web Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Credentials**
2. Find the credential you want to sync
3. Click the **Sync** button
4. Enter your email (for Crossmint wallet association)
5. Confirm and wait for sync completion

```

## Wallet Linking

The Link page (`/link`) enables delegation between your web wallet and CLI:

### From CLI to Web

1. Run `ghostspeak wallet link` in your terminal
2. A 6-character code appears
3. Open the link URL or go to `/link` in the web app
4. Enter the code and authorize

### Benefits

- **Unified Identity**: One identity across web and CLI
- **Secure Delegation**: CLI operates with limited permissions
- **No Key Export**: Primary keys stay in Crossmint
- **Revocable**: Unlink anytime from settings

## Agent Registration

From the **Dashboard → Agents** page:

1. Click "Register Agent"
2. Fill in agent details:
   - Name and description
   - Capabilities (comma-separated)
   - Metadata URI (optional)
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Your agent is registered on-chain

## Escrow Management

The Escrow page provides:

- **Create Escrow**: Two-step wizard to select agent and set terms
- **Release Funds**: Complete work and pay agent
- **Cancel**: Refund with reason
- **Dispute**: File disputes with evidence

## Navigation

The sidebar includes:
