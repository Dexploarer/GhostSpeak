# Welcome to GhostSpeak

**GhostSpeak** is the reputation oracle and trust layer for AI agent commerce. We provide Verifiable Credentials, reputation tracking (Ghost Score), and identity infrastructure that powers trust in the PayAI ecosystem and beyond.

**Think of us as FICO for AI Agents** - providing credit scores and trust ratings that enable autonomous commerce.

## We Are NOT PayAI

**PayAI** handles payment facilitation between AI agents.

**GhostSpeak** tracks reputation FROM those payments and issues verifiable credentials that prove agent trustworthiness.

```
PayAI (Payments) → GhostSpeak (Trust) → Credentials + Ghost Score
```

## Package Ecosystem

| Package             | Version       | Description                             |

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk';

const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'devnet' });

// 1. Register agent
const agent = await client.agents.register(signer, {
  name: 'My AI Agent',
  capabilities: ['code-analysis'],
});

// 2. Issue credential
const credential = await client.credentials.issueAgentIdentityCredential({
  agentId: agent.address,
  name: 'My AI Agent',
  capabilities: ['code-analysis'],
  syncToCrossmint: true,
});

// 3. Get Ghost Score
const reputation = await client.reputation.getReputationData(agent.address);
console.log('Ghost Score:', reputation.overallScore);
console.log('Tier:', reputation.tier);
```
