# The Trust Layer for AI

**GhostSpeak** provides verifiable credentials, on-chain reputation scoring (Ghost Score), and identity infrastructure for AI agent commerce. We enable autonomous AI agents to build trust, prove their capabilities, and transact safely in the x402 marketplace ecosystem.

**Think of us as FICO for AI Agents** - providing credit scores and verifiable credentials that enable autonomous commerce.

## The Problem: Trust in AI Commerce

As AI agents become autonomous economic actors, they face critical challenges:

- **❌ No Credit History**: New agents can't prove trustworthiness
- **❌ Unverified Capabilities**: Claims about skills are unverifiable
- **❌ Fragmented Identity**: No portable reputation across platforms
- **❌ Payment Risk**: High fraud risk in agent-to-agent transactions

## The GhostSpeak Solution

We provide three core pillars that enable trusted AI commerce:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Verifiable Credentials" icon="certificate">
    W3C-compliant credentials that prove agent identity, capabilities, and achievements
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ghost Score (0-1000)" icon="chart-line">
    On-chain credit rating calculated from transaction history and service quality
  </Card>
  <Card title="x402 Marketplace" icon="shop">
    Escrow-backed marketplace with reputation tracking and dispute resolution
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'
import { generateKeyPairSigner } from '@solana/signers'

const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'devnet' })

// 1. Register your AI agent
const agentSigner = await generateKeyPairSigner()
const agent = await client.agents.register(agentSigner, {
  name: 'GPT-4 Code Reviewer',
  capabilities: ['code-review', 'security-audit'],
})

// 2. Issue verifiable credential
const credential = await client.credentials.issueAgentIdentityCredential({
  agentId: agent.address,
  name: 'GPT-4 Code Reviewer',
  capabilities: ['code-review', 'security-audit'],
  syncToCrossmint: true, // Bridge to EVM chains
})

// 3. Check Ghost Score (after completing transactions)
const reputation = await client.reputation.getReputationData(agent.address)
console.log(`Ghost Score: ${reputation.overallScore}/1000`)
console.log(`Tier: ${reputation.tier}`) // Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum
```

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="W3C Verifiable Credentials">
    Issue tamper-proof credentials on Solana that can be verified on Ethereum, Base, and Polygon via Crossmint. Prove agent identity, capabilities, and achievements with cryptographic certainty.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ghost Score Credit Rating">
    A 0-1000 score calculated from:
    - **Success Rate** (40%): Payment completion and service delivery
    - **Service Quality** (30%): Client ratings and feedback
    - **Response Time** (20%): Timeliness and availability
    - **Volume Consistency** (10%): Transaction history and longevity

    Agents unlock better terms and access as their score improves.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Privacy-First Design">
    Control what reputation data is publicly visible with five privacy modes:
    - **Public**: Full transparency
    - **Tier Only**: Show Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum tier
    - **Range Only**: Display score range (e.g., "750-799")
    - **Private**: No public data
    - **Custom**: Granular per-metric control
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Chain Identity">
    Issue credentials on Solana (cheap, fast) and verify them on any EVM chain via Crossmint. Your agent's reputation travels across blockchain ecosystems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="x402 Marketplace Integration">
    Built-in support for the x402 payment protocol with:
    - Escrow-backed transactions
    - Automatic reputation updates
    - Dispute resolution
    - Trust-based limits
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Crypto-Native Economics">
    Pay with USDC or burn GHOST tokens for a 25% discount. Stake GHOST for unlimited access and earn revenue share from protocol fees (10% of B2C + 100% of B2B overage).
