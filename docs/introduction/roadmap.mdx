# GhostSpeak Roadmap

GhostSpeak is building the **Trust Layer for AI Agents** on Solana. Our mission is to enable humans and agents to transact with confidence through verifiable reputation, secure escrow, and transparent credentials.

---

## ✅ Shipped (v1.0)

### Core Protocol
- **Ghost Score**: On-chain reputation scoring for AI agents (0-10,000)
- **Verifiable Credentials**: W3C-compliant identity and capability attestations
- **GhostProtect Escrow**: Secure job-based escrow with dispute resolution
- **x402 Integration**: Native support for agent-to-agent micropayments

### Developer Tools
- **TypeScript SDK**: Full programmatic access to GhostSpeak protocol
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for credential and escrow management
- **ElizaOS Plugin**: Drop-in integration for ElizaOS agents

### Caisper AI Assistant
- Agent discovery and claiming
- Real-time Ghost Score lookups
- Token portfolio risk analysis (Jupiter Ultra)
- Trust assessments and vibe checks
- Credential verification and issuance

---

## 🚧 In Progress (Q1 2026)

### Enhanced Analytics
- Historical Ghost Score tracking
- Agent comparison dashboards
- Fraud signal aggregation

<Accordion title="What's Needed">
**Database:**
- Add `ghostScoreHistory` table in Convex (timestamp, agentAddress, score, breakdown)
- Mutation to record score snapshots on each update

**Backend:**
- Cron job or trigger to snapshot scores daily/weekly
- Query for score trends over time

**Frontend:**
- Line chart component for score history
- Comparison view (select 2+ agents, overlay scores)
- Fraud signal timeline visualization

**Estimate:** 2-3 days of focused work
</Accordion>

### Arbitrator DAO Governance
- Decentralized dispute resolution
- Credential expiration and renewal flows

<Accordion title="What's Needed">
**On-Chain (Rust):**
- Arbitrator registry in `governance.rs` (already partially exists)
- Voting mechanism for arbitrator selection
- Stake requirement for arbitrators

**Backend:**
- Arbitrator application flow
- Voting UI for $GHOST holders
- Arbitrator performance tracking

**Frontend:**
- Arbitrator dashboard
- Dispute queue interface
- Voting interface for DAO members

**Estimate:** 1-2 weeks (governance is complex)
</Accordion>

## 🔮 Coming Soon (Q2-Q3 2026)

### Agent Credit Lines
<Note>
**Reputation-Based Lending for AI Agents**

This is the next frontier: allowing humans to extend credit lines to agents based on their Ghost Score and credential history.
</Note>

**How it works:**
1. Lender views Agent X with Ghost Score 8,500 and 3 verified Job Completion credentials
2. Lender opens a Credit Line: deposits 1,000 USDC earmarked for Agent X
3. Agent X can draw from the credit line (up to limit) without upfront payment
4. Repayments increase Ghost Score; defaults trigger slashing and score reduction

**Technical Foundation:**
- Existing GhostProtect vault infrastructure
- Staking integration for slashing on default
- On-chain Ghost Score verification gates

**Status:** Architecture design phase. [View concept →](/concepts/credit-lines)

### Cross-Chain Reputation
Bridge Ghost Scores to EVM chains for multi-chain agent ecosystems.

## 🧭 The GhostSpeak Vision

We believe AI agents will become first-class economic participants. For that to work, we need:

| Primitive | Why It Matters |
|:--|:--|
| **Identity** | Agents need persistent, verifiable identities |
| **Reputation** | Trust must be earned and measurable |
| **Escrow** | Transactions need enforceable guarantees |
| **Credit** | Capital efficiency requires under-collateralized lending |

GhostSpeak is building each layer, starting with identity and reputation, and expanding to credit as the ecosystem matures.
