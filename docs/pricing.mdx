description: 'Crypto-native pricing for Ghost Score verifications'
---

## Overview

GhostSpeak uses a **crypto-native pricing model** powered by USDC stablecoins and the $GHOST utility token. No credit cards, no subscriptions, no recurring billing—just transparent, on-chain payments.

## Ghost Score Verification Pricing

### Freemium

Get started with **3 free verifications per month**:

- Check any AI agent's reputation
- View Ghost Score (0-1000)
- See payment history and success rate
- No wallet required for read-only access

**Perfect for:** Testing the platform, occasional checks, personal use

---

### Pay-Per-Check

**1 USDC per verification** (no commitment)

#### Payment Options:

1. **USDC** - 1 USDC per check
2. **Credit Card** - $1.03 via Crossmint (includes 3% processing fee)
3. **GHOST Token (25% discount)** - Burn 75 GHOST per check

**How it works:**

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk';

const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'mainnet' });

// Option 1: Pay with USDC
await client.verifyAgent({
  agentId: 'agent_address',
  paymentMethod: 'usdc',
});

// Option 2: Pay by burning GHOST (25% discount)
await client.verifyAgent({
  agentId: 'agent_address',
  paymentMethod: 'ghost_burn',
  ghostAmount: 75_000_000n, // 75 GHOST (6 decimals)
});
```

**Perfect for:** Occasional verifications, pay-as-you-go users

---

### Staking Tiers (Unlimited Access + Revenue Share)

Stake $GHOST tokens to unlock unlimited verifications **and earn revenue share** from protocol fees.

| Tier | Stake Required | Benefits | Revenue Share Multiplier |
|------|----------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Verified Staker** | 5,000 GHOST | Unlimited verifications<br/>"Verified Reviewer" badge (2x review weight)<br/>Early feature access | **1.5x** |
| **Pro Staker** | 50,000 GHOST | Everything in Verified<br/>API access (100K requests/month)<br/>Webhook notifications<br/>Priority support<br/>2x governance voting power | **2x** |
| **Whale Staker** | 500,000 GHOST | Everything in Pro<br/>Unlimited API requests<br/>White-label options<br/>Direct team access<br/>20% protocol fee discount | **3x** |

#### Revenue Share Explained

**How it works:**

1. **Protocol Revenue**: 10% of all B2C verification fees go to the staker rewards pool
2. **Your Share**: Proportional to your weighted stake (stake × tier multiplier)
3. **Claim Anytime**: USDC rewards accrue daily, claim when you want
4. **Variable APY**: Rewards depend on protocol revenue (see Transparency Dashboard)

**Example Calculation:**

```typescript
// Staked Amount: 10,000 GHOST
// Tier: Verified Staker (1.5x multiplier)
// Weighted Stake: 10,000 × 1.5 = 15,000 GHOST

// Protocol Revenue This Month: $50,000 USDC
// Staker Rewards Pool (10%): $5,000 USDC

// Total Weighted Stake (All Users): 5,000,000 GHOST
// Your Share: (15,000 / 5,000,000) × $5,000 = $15 USDC

// Annualized (if consistent):
// Monthly: $15 → Annual: $180
// Your Stake Value (at $0.015/GHOST): $150
// Estimated APY: ($180 / $150) × 100 = 120%
```

<Warning>
  **APY Disclaimer**: APY is variable and depends on:
  1. Protocol revenue (fluctuates monthly)
  2. Total staked GHOST (dilutes your share)
  3. GHOST token price (affects stake value)

  Past performance does NOT guarantee future results. APY may be 0% in months with no revenue. This is not a security—it's a utility token with a revenue-sharing mechanism.
</Warning>

### Break-Even Analysis

**When does staking make sense?**

| Monthly Verifications | Pay-Per-Check Cost | Break-Even Stake | Recommendation |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1-10 checks/month | $1-10 | N/A | Pay-per-check |
| 10-50 checks/month | $10-50 | Consider staking | Borderline |
| 50+ checks/month | $50+ | **Stake 5K GHOST** | Staking saves money |
| 100+ API calls/month | N/A | **Stake 50K GHOST** | Pro tier required |

**At current GHOST price ($0.00005691):**

- 5,000 GHOST stake = **$0.28** (one-time)
- 50,000 GHOST stake = **$2.85** (one-time)
- 500,000 GHOST stake = **$28.46** (one-time)

<Tip>
  Token price is expected to appreciate as protocol grows. Early stakers benefit from:
  1. **Revenue share** (USDC rewards)
  2. **Token appreciation** (GHOST price increase)
  3. **Unlimited access** (no per-check fees)
</Tip>

## B2B API Pricing

Enterprises can prepay for API access via **USDC token accounts** or **stake GHOST** for unlimited usage.

### Prepaid Model (USDC)

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Included Requests | Overage Fee | Best For |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Starter** | 50 USDC/month | 10,000 requests | 0.01 USDC/request | Small projects |
| **Growth** | 250 USDC/month | 100,000 requests | 0.005 USDC/request | Growing teams |
| **Scale** | 1,000 USDC/month | 500,000 requests | 0.002 USDC/request | Large deployments |
| **Enterprise** | Custom (5K-50K USDC) | Custom | Negotiable | Custom integrations |

**How it works:**

1. Create team account
2. Deposit USDC to your team's token account
3. API usage deducts in real-time
4. Low balance notifications
5. Refill anytime

**Example Integration:**

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakB2BClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk';

const b2bClient = new GhostSpeakB2BClient({
  apiKey: process.env.GHOSTSPEAK_API_KEY,
  teamId: 'your-team-id',
});

// Check balance
const balance = await b2bClient.getTeamBalance();
console.log(`Remaining: ${balance.currentBalance} USDC`);

// Verify agent (auto-deducts from balance)
const reputation = await b2bClient.verifyAgent(agentId);
```

### Staking Model (GHOST Alternative)

**Instead of prepaying USDC, stake GHOST for unlimited API access:**

| Tier | Stake Required | Equivalent Monthly Value | Included Requests | Revenue Share |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Starter-Equivalent** | 10,000 GHOST | ~50 USDC | 10,000 requests | 1.5x multiplier |
| **Growth-Equivalent** | 50,000 GHOST | ~250 USDC | 100,000 requests | 2x multiplier |
| **Scale-Equivalent** | 200,000 GHOST | ~1,000 USDC | 500,000 requests | 2.5x multiplier |
| **Enterprise-Equivalent** | 500,000+ GHOST | Custom | Unlimited | 3x multiplier |

**Benefits of Staking vs Prepaid:**

| Feature | Prepaid USDC | Staking GHOST |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Monthly Cost | Recurring | One-time stake (recoverable) |
| Overage Fees | Yes (0.002-0.01 USDC/request) | No (unlimited after threshold) |
| Revenue Share | No | Yes (proportional to stake) |
| Token Appreciation | No | Yes (benefit from GHOST price increase) |
| Governance Rights | No | Yes (vote on protocol changes) |

<Note>
  **100% of B2B overage fees** go to the staker rewards pool, creating additional revenue for stakers.
</Note>

## Revenue Distribution Breakdown

**Where do your payments go?**

### B2C Pay-Per-Check (1 USDC)

- **90%** → Protocol treasury (development, security, operations)
- **10%** → Staker rewards pool (distributed to GHOST stakers)

### B2B Overage Fees (0.002-0.01 USDC per extra request)

- **100%** → Staker rewards pool (higher margin for stakers)

### GHOST Token Burning (75 GHOST per check)

- **100%** → Burned (permanently removed from supply)
- **Benefit**: Deflationary pressure increases GHOST value for stakers

**Annual Projections (Conservative Year 1):**

- Total Protocol Revenue: **$4.5M**
- Staker Rewards Pool: **$650K** (~14% of revenue)
- Estimated APY (at 10% supply staked): **43%** (variable)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why crypto instead of credit cards?">
    - **Lower fees**: No Stripe 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
    - **Instant settlement**: No 7-day payment holds
    - **Global access**: No country restrictions
    - **Transparency**: All payments on-chain, publicly auditable
    - **Revenue sharing**: Stakers earn protocol fees (impossible with fiat)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is staking safe? Can I lose my GHOST?">
    - **No smart contract risk**: Stake only in audited GhostSpeak protocol
    - **Unstake anytime**: No lockup periods, withdraw your GHOST whenever
    - **No slashing**: We don't penalize stakers for any reason
    - **Price risk**: GHOST price can fluctuate (but you earn USDC rewards)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if APY drops to 0%?">
    APY is tied to protocol revenue. If revenue is low, APY will be low. However:
    - You still get unlimited verifications (saving money vs pay-per-check)
    - Your GHOST is never locked—unstake if APY is unsatisfactory
    - As protocol grows, revenue (and APY) should increase
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use GHOST for payments instead of USDC?">
    Yes! Burn 75 GHOST per verification for a **25% discount** vs 1 USDC. This permanently removes GHOST from circulation, creating deflationary pressure that benefits all holders.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do B2B plans include revenue share?">
    **Prepaid USDC plans**: No revenue share (you're paying for service)

    **Staking alternative**: Yes! Stake GHOST instead of prepaying USDC to earn revenue share + unlimited API access. For example, stake 50K GHOST instead of paying 250 USDC/month.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Legal Disclaimers

<Warning>
  **Important Legal Notices:**

  1. **Variable APY**: APY is calculated from actual protocol revenue and varies monthly. Past performance does not guarantee future results. APY may be 0% in months with no revenue.

  2. **Not a Security**: GHOST is a utility token, not a security. Staking provides protocol access and revenue sharing from actual usage, not investment returns.

  3. **No Guaranteed Returns**: We make no promises of fixed APY or minimum returns. All staking rewards depend on protocol performance.

  4. **Price Risk**: GHOST token price is volatile and can decrease. You may lose value if the price drops below your entry point.

  5. **Smart Contract Risk**: While audited, smart contracts can have bugs. Use at your own risk.

  6. **Regulatory Risk**: Crypto regulations are evolving. Staking rewards may be taxable in your jurisdiction.
</Warning>
