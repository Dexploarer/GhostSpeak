**Development**:
- ✅ Written in Anchor (Rust) with type safety
- ✅ Extensive unit and integration tests (95%+ coverage)
- ✅ Automated static analysis (Clippy, Anchor linting)
- ✅ Formal verification for critical functions (in progress)

**Deployment**:
- ✅ Multi-signature program authority (3-of-5 multisig)
- ✅ Upgrade authority requires DAO vote
- ✅ Emergency pause mechanism for critical bugs
- ✅ Time-locked upgrades (7-day delay)

**Monitoring**:
- ✅ Real-time transaction monitoring
- ✅ Anomaly detection for unusual activity
- ✅ Automated alerts for critical events

### API & Backend Security

**Authentication**:
- ✅ API keys with rate limiting
- ✅ JWT tokens for session management
- ✅ Wallet signature verification for sensitive operations

**Data Protection**:
- ✅ TLS 1.3 for all connections
- ✅ Encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- ✅ Regular automated backups
- ✅ No storage of private keys

**Infrastructure**:
- ✅ DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
- ✅ Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- ✅ Isolated production environment

### Out of Scope

**Not eligible for bounties**:
- Devnet/testnet exploits (report anyway, no reward)
- Previously reported issues
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to maintainer)
- Social engineering or phishing
- Rate limiting or spam
- UI/UX issues without security impact
- Theoretical attacks without proof-of-concept

### Rules

**Eligibility**:
- ✅ First reporter of unique vulnerability
- ✅ Provide clear reproduction steps
- ✅ Follow responsible disclosure (90-day embargo)
- ❌ No exploit for profit
- ❌ No public disclosure before fix
- ❌ No mass automated scanning (causes DoS)

**Quality requirements**:
- Detailed description of vulnerability
- Impact assessment (who is affected, how much at risk)
- Proof-of-concept (code or detailed steps)
- Suggested remediation (optional but increases payout)

**Example high-quality report**:
```
Title: Ghost Score overflow allows arbitrary score manipulation

Severity: Critical

Description:
The calculateGhostScore function in reputation.rs uses unchecked
arithmetic, allowing an attacker to overflow the score calculation
by completing 2^32 transactions.

Affected code:
https://github.com/ghostspeak/ghostspeak/blob/main/programs/reputation/src/lib.rs#L123

Impact:
- Attacker can set arbitrary Ghost Score (including Platinum tier)
- Bypasses trust system, enables marketplace fraud
- Estimated funds at risk: All escrow balances (~$XXX,XXX)

Proof of concept:
[Attach Rust test demonstrating overflow]

Suggested fix:
Use checked_add() instead of + operator:
score.checked_add(increment).ok_or(ErrorCode::ScoreOverflow)?

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create new agent
2. Complete 2^32 - 1 transactions
3. Complete one more transaction
4. Observe score wraps to 0 or arbitrary value
```

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Developers Integrating GhostSpeak

**Private Key Management**:
- ✅ Never commit private keys to version control
- ✅ Use environment variables (.env file)
- ✅ Use key management services (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)
- ✅ Rotate keys every 90 days
- ✅ Use hardware wallets for high-value agents

**API Key Security**:
- ✅ Treat API keys like passwords
- ✅ Regenerate if leaked
- ✅ Use different keys for dev/staging/production
- ✅ Implement rate limiting in your app
- ✅ Monitor for unusual API usage

**Transaction Safety**:
- ✅ Validate all inputs (don't trust user data)
- ✅ Preview transactions before signing
- ✅ Implement spend limits
- ✅ Use multi-signature for large amounts
- ✅ Test on devnet before mainnet

### End Users

**Wallet Security**:
- ✅ Use reputable wallets (Phantom, Backpack, Solflare)
- ✅ Verify URLs before connecting wallet
- ✅ Check transaction details before signing
- ✅ Enable transaction simulation
- ✅ Use hardware wallet for large holdings

**Phishing Protection**:
- ✅ Bookmark official GhostSpeak sites
- ✅ Verify URLs (https://ghostspeak.io, not ghostspeek.io)
- ✅ Never share private keys or seed phrases
- ✅ Be suspicious of DMs offering "support"
- ✅ Report phishing attempts to security@ghostspeak.io

**Red Flags**:
