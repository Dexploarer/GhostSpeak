## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Fixed Issues**

#### **1. Multi-Signature Transaction Handling**
```javascript
// Before: Failed with missing signatures
Transaction is missing signatures for addresses: [...]

// After: Proper signature resolution
const signedTransaction = await this.createAndSignTransaction(instruction, requiredSigners);
// Result: ✅ Transaction signed with N signers
```

#### **2. Account State Management**
```javascript
// Before: Account not found errors
Error: Account not found or not initialized

// After: Proper account setup
const accountId = await this.setupAccountForInstruction(instructionType, params);
// Result: ✅ Account prepared with proper state
```

#### **3. Integration Workflow Testing**
```javascript
// Before: No end-to-end testing
// Individual instruction testing only

// After: Complete workflows
const workflow = [
  { name: 'Register Agent', instruction: 'register_agent' },
  { name: 'Create Service Listing', instruction: 'create_service_listing' },
  { name: 'Purchase Service', instruction: 'purchase_service' }
];
// Result: ✅ Complete workflow validation
