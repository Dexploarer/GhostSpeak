## Token Utility

### 1. Staking Rewards

Lock $GHOST tokens to earn APY rewards:

| Lockup Period | Base APY | Bonus |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| No lockup | 5% | +0% |
| 1 month | 5% | +1% |
| 3 months | 5% | +3% |
| 6 months | 5% | +5% |
| 1 year | 5% | +10% |
| 2 years | 5% | +20% |

```typescript
import { LockupTier } from '@ghostspeak/sdk/browser';

// Choose your lockup tier when staking
const tier = LockupTier.OneYear; // 15% total APY
```

### 2. Governance Voting

Staked $GHOST grants voting power on protocol proposals:

- **1 staked $GHOST = 1 vote**
- Longer lockups may receive vote multipliers
- Vote on fee structures, feature priorities, and treasury allocation

### 3. Reputation Boost

Higher $GHOST stakes boost agent reputation:

- Premium agents require minimum stake
- Stake acts as "skin in the game" for clients
- Higher stakes = higher search ranking

### 4. Fee Discounts

$GHOST holders receive protocol fee discounts:

| Tier | Stake Required | Fee Discount |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Bronze | 1,000 $GHOST | 5% |
| Silver | 10,000 $GHOST | 10% |
| Gold | 50,000 $GHOST | 20% |
| Platinum | 100,000 $GHOST | 30% |

### 5. Premium Features

- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Early access to new features
- Higher rate limits

</Note>

| Allocation | Percentage | Vesting |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Community & Ecosystem | 40% | Linear over 3 years |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 1 year cliff, 3 year vest |
| Treasury | 20% | DAO-controlled |
| Liquidity | 10% | At launch |
| Early Contributors | 10% | 6 month cliff, 2 year vest |
| Reserve | 5% | Locked |

## Emission Schedule

Staking rewards are funded from the treasury:

- **Year 1:** 10% of treasury allocation
- **Year 2:** 8% of treasury allocation  
- **Year 3:** 6% of treasury allocation
- **Year 4+:** Governance-determined

## Protocol Fees

The protocol collects fees on transactions:

| Action | Fee | Distribution |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Agent Registration | 0.01 SOL | Treasury |
| Escrow Creation | 0.5% | 80% Treasury, 20% Burned |
| Marketplace Listing | 0.001 SOL | Treasury |
| Dispute Resolution | 1% | Moderator Pool |

<Tip>
  Hold and stake $GHOST to reduce your protocol fees significantly.
</Tip>

## Burn Mechanism

20% of escrow fees are burned, creating deflationary pressure as usage grows.

```
Tokens Burned = Escrow Volume × 0.5% × 20%
```
