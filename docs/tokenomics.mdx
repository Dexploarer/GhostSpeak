## Token Utility

### 1. Revenue-Share Staking

**Stake GHOST to earn USDC rewards from protocol revenue.**

Unlike traditional staking with fixed APY, GhostSpeak shares **actual protocol revenue** with stakers. This creates alignment between users and protocol growth.

**How it works:**

1. **Stake GHOST** in the protocol (no lockup)
2. **Earn USDC** from 10% of protocol revenue
3. **Claim anytime** (rewards accrue daily)
4. **Unstake anytime** (no penalties)

#### Staking Tiers

| Tier | Stake Required | Revenue Share Multiplier | Benefits |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|----------|
| **Basic Staker** | 1,000 GHOST | 1x | Proportional revenue share<br/>Governance voting |
| **Verified Staker** | 5,000 GHOST | **1.5x** | Unlimited verifications<br/>"Verified Reviewer" badge<br/>Early feature access |
| **Pro Staker** | 50,000 GHOST | **2x** | API access (100K requests/month)<br/>Webhooks<br/>Priority support<br/>2x governance power |
| **Whale Staker** | 500,000 GHOST | **3x** | Unlimited API<br/>White-label options<br/>Direct team access<br/>20% protocol fee discount |

**Revenue Share Formula:**

```typescript
// Your monthly USDC reward calculation:
const protocolRevenue = 50000; // Monthly protocol revenue in USDC
const stakerPool = protocolRevenue * 0.10; // 10% → stakers = 5,000 USDC

const yourStake = 10000; // GHOST staked
const tierMultiplier = 1.5; // Verified Staker tier
const yourWeightedStake = yourStake * tierMultiplier; // 15,000

const totalWeightedStake = 5000000; // All stakers combined (weighted)

const yourShare = (yourWeightedStake / totalWeightedStake) * stakerPool;
// = (15,000 / 5,000,000) × 5,000
// = 15 USDC per month

// Calculate APY:
const ghostPrice = 0.00005691; // Current GHOST price
const yourStakeValue = yourStake * ghostPrice; // $0.57
const annualRewards = yourShare * 12; // $180
const apy = (annualRewards / yourStakeValue) * 100; // 31,579% APY

// NOTE: APY decreases as GHOST price increases (more sustainable)
```

<Warning>
  **APY Disclaimer:**

  APY is **VARIABLE** and depends on:
  1. Protocol revenue (fluctuates monthly)
  2. Total staked GHOST (dilutes your share)
  3. GHOST token price (affects stake value)

  **We do NOT promise fixed returns.** APY may be 0% in months with no revenue. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

  This is **NOT a security**—it's a utility token with revenue-sharing from actual protocol usage.
</Warning>

---

### 2. Protocol Access

**Stake GHOST to unlock unlimited Ghost Score verifications and API access.**

Instead of paying 1 USDC per verification, stake once and get unlimited access:

| Access Level | Without Staking | With Staking (5K GHOST) | Savings |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|---------|
| 10 checks/month | $10 USDC | $0 (after $0.28 stake) | **$119.72/year** |
| 50 checks/month | $50 USDC | $0 | **$599.72/year** |
| 100 checks/month | $100 USDC | $0 | **$1,199.72/year** |

**At current GHOST price:**
- 5,000 GHOST = $0.28 (one-time)
- 50,000 GHOST = $2.85 (one-time)
- 500,000 GHOST = $28.46 (one-time)

<Tip>
  Early stakers benefit from both **revenue share** AND **token price appreciation** as the protocol grows.
</Tip>

---

### 3. Deflationary Burning

**Pay with GHOST instead of USDC for a 25% discount—tokens are permanently burned.**

**Payment Options:**

- **USDC:** 1 USDC per verification
- **GHOST (25% discount):** 75 GHOST per verification (burned forever)

**Deflationary Impact:**

If 100,000 verifications per month are paid with GHOST:
- **Monthly Burn:** 7,500,000 GHOST
- **Annual Burn:** 90,000,000 GHOST (9% of supply)
- **Result:** Reduced supply → increased scarcity → higher value for holders

**Why burning benefits stakers:**

1. Fewer tokens in circulation
2. Same revenue share pool size
3. Higher rewards per token staked
4. Increased token price (supply/demand)

```typescript
import { GhostSpeakClient } from '@ghostspeak/sdk';

const client = new GhostSpeakClient({ cluster: 'mainnet' });

// Burn 75 GHOST for verification (25% discount)
await client.verifyAgent({
  agentId: 'agent_address',
  paymentMethod: 'ghost_burn',
  ghostAmount: 75_000_000n, // 75 GHOST (6 decimals)
});

// GHOST is sent to burn address (permanent removal)
```

### 4. Governance Voting

**Staked GHOST grants voting power on protocol proposals.**

- **1 staked GHOST = 1 vote** (base)
- **Tier multipliers apply:** Pro tier = 2x votes, Whale tier = 3x votes
- **No lockup required:** Vote while earning revenue share

**Governance Scope:**

- Protocol fee adjustments
- Revenue distribution percentages
- Staking tier thresholds
- New feature prioritization
- Treasury spending proposals

**Governance Process:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Propose">
    Create proposal with 10,000 GHOST stake minimum
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discussion">
    7-day community discussion period
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voting">
    5-day voting period, 10% quorum required
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    Passed proposals execute after 2-day timelock
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Revenue Sources

**Where does the staker revenue pool come from?**

### 1. B2C Pay-Per-Check Fees

- **User pays:** 1 USDC per verification
- **To staker pool:** 0.1 USDC (10%)
- **To treasury:** 0.9 USDC (90%)

**Example:** 100,000 checks/month = $10,000 to staker pool

---

### 2. Crossmint Processing Spread

- **User pays:** $1.03 via credit card
- **Crossmint fee:** ~$0.03 (3%)
- **Protocol receives:** 1 USDC
- **To staker pool:** 0.1 USDC (10%)

**Example:** 50,000 credit card payments/month = $5,000 to staker pool

---

### 3. B2B API Overage Fees

- **Client exceeds quota:** Pays 0.002-0.01 USDC per extra request
- **To staker pool:** 100% (higher margin, full reward to stakers)

**Example:** 10M overage requests/month at 0.005 USDC = $50,000 to staker pool

---

### 4. PayAI Integration Fees (Future)

- **Revenue share from PayAI** for reputation data
- **Estimated:** 0.5% of verified payment volume
- **To staker pool:** 100%

**Example:** $100M PayAI volume/month = $500,000 to staker pool

---

### 5. Credential Issuance Fees (Future)

- **Enterprises pay:** 0.1 USDC per credential issued
- **To staker pool:** 50%

**Example:** 500,000 credentials/month = $25,000 to staker pool

## Revenue Projections

**Conservative Year 1 Estimates:**

| Revenue Source | Monthly | Annual |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| B2C Verifications | $100,000 | $1,200,000 |
| B2B Base Fees | $275,000 | $3,300,000 |
| B2B Overage Fees | ~$20,000 | ~$240,000 |
| **Total Protocol Revenue** | **$395,000** | **$4,740,000** |

**Staker Rewards Pool:**

- 10% of B2C: $120,000/year
- 10% of B2B base: $330,000/year
- 100% of B2B overage: $240,000/year
- **Total to stakers:** **$690,000/year**

**Estimated APY (Example Scenario):**

- If 100M GHOST staked (10% of supply)
- At $0.015/GHOST = $1.5M total value locked
- APY = $690K / $1.5M = **46% APY**

<Note>
  **This is an estimate.** Actual APY depends on real protocol revenue and total staked GHOST. Use the [Transparency Dashboard](/transparency) for real-time APY calculations.

## Price Scenarios

**What if GHOST price increases?**

| Scenario | GHOST Price | Market Cap | 10% Staked TVL | Est. APY (at $690K rewards) |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Current** | $0.00005691 | $57K | $5,700 | 12,105% (unsustainable) |
| **10x** | $0.0005691 | $570K | $57,000 | 1,211% |
| **100x** | $0.005691 | $5.7M | $570,000 | 121% |
| **1000x** | $0.05691 | $57M | $5,700,000 | 12.1% |

**Key Insight:** As GHOST price increases, APY normalizes to sustainable DeFi rates (10-30%). Early stakers benefit from:

1. **High APY** while price is low
2. **Token appreciation** as protocol grows
3. **Unlimited access** (no pay-per-check fees)

---

## Risks & Disclaimers

<Warning>
  **Investment Risks:**

  1. **Price Volatility**: GHOST is a microcap token with high volatility (-23% in 24h). Price can drop significantly.

  2. **Liquidity Risk**: Low liquidity ($22K) means large trades impact price heavily. May be difficult to buy/sell large amounts.

  3. **Variable APY**: APY depends on protocol revenue. May be 0% in months with no revenue or low usage.

  4. **Smart Contract Risk**: While audited, smart contracts can have bugs. Stake at your own risk.

  5. **Regulatory Risk**: Crypto regulations are evolving. Staking rewards may be taxable.

  6. **No Guarantees**: We make NO promises of fixed returns, minimum APY, or token price appreciation.

  **This is NOT financial advice. DYOR (Do Your Own Research).**
</Warning>

## Legal Compliance

**GHOST is NOT a security under the Howey Test:**

1. **Investment of Money:** Users buy on open market, not from GhostSpeak
2. **Common Enterprise:** No pooled investment, decentralized DEX trading
3. **Expectation of Profits:** Staking rewards = revenue share, not profit from others' work
4. **Efforts of Others:** Users provide utility (staking), protocol shares revenue

**Safe Harbor:**

- Token launched independently (pump.fun)
- GhostSpeak does NOT control token (mint/freeze revoked)
- Staking = utility unlock (protocol access), not investment return
- Revenue from actual protocol usage (not new investor money)
- Fully transparent on-chain accounting

**Terms of Service:**

By staking GHOST, you agree:

1. APY varies and may be 0%
2. Not an investment—rewards from protocol usage
3. GHOST is a utility token, not a security
4. Staking is voluntary for protocol access
5. No guaranteed returns of any kind
6. You are responsible for tax obligations
