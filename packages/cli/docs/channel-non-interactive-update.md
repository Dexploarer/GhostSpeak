# Channel Creation Non-Interactive Mode Update

## Summary

Added non-interactive support to the channel creation command, following the same pattern as the agent registration implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. CLI Command Definition (`src/index.ts`)
- Added `--yes` flag to skip confirmation prompts
- Added `--non-interactive` flag to run in fully non-interactive mode (implies --yes)
- Updated channel create action to pass these options to the createChannel function

### 2. Channel Command Implementation (`src/commands/channel.ts`)
- Added `yes` and `nonInteractive` properties to `CreateChannelOptions` interface
- Added non-interactive mode detection: `options.nonInteractive || options.yes || process.env.CI === 'true'`
- Skipped channel details display in non-interactive mode
- Skipped confirmation prompt in non-interactive mode
- Added minimal output format for non-interactive mode (only Channel ID and Transaction signature)
- Added "Non-interactive mode: proceeding with channel creation..." message

### 3. Behavior in Non-Interactive Mode
- No confirmation prompts are shown
- Channel details preview is skipped
- Success output is minimal (just Channel ID and Transaction signature)
- Next steps guidance is omitted
- Process continues with sensible defaults for any missing options

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic non-interactive channel creation
ghostspeak channel create TestChannel --non-interactive

# With --yes flag (same behavior)
ghostspeak channel create TestChannel --yes

# Non-interactive with all options
ghostspeak channel create PrivateChannel \
  --non-interactive \
  --private \
  --encrypted \
  --description "Private team channel" \
  --max-participants 50

# In CI/CD environments (automatically non-interactive)
CI=true ghostspeak channel create BuildChannel
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
1. Unit tests (`src/commands/channel.test.ts`) - All 4 tests passing
2. Integration tests (`test/channel-cli-integration.test.ts`) - All tests passing
3. Manual testing shows commands complete without hanging on prompts

## Consistency with Agent Registration

The implementation follows the exact same pattern as the agent registration command:
- Same flag names (`--yes`, `--non-interactive`)
- Same environment variable check (`process.env.CI`)
- Same conditional logic for skipping interactive elements
- Same minimal output format in non-interactive mode
