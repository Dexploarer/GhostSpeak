export const TIMEOUT_MESSAGES = {
  CHANNEL_CREATE: `
‚è±Ô∏è  Channel creation is taking longer than expected (30+ seconds).

This could be due to:
‚Ä¢ Network congestion on Solana
‚Ä¢ RPC endpoint responding slowly
‚Ä¢ Insufficient transaction priority fee

üîß Immediate solutions:
1. Wait 60 seconds and retry - network congestion often clears quickly
2. Run: ghostspeak doctor --verbose
3. Check your balance: solana balance
4. Use a faster RPC: ghostspeak config set rpcUrl https://api.devnet.solana.com

üöÄ For better performance:
‚Ä¢ Get a free RPC endpoint from Helius, QuickNode, or Alchemy
‚Ä¢ Increase priority fee for faster confirmation
‚Ä¢ Try during off-peak hours (avoid US business hours)
`,

  TRANSACTION_SEND: `
‚è±Ô∏è  Transaction confirmation timeout (20+ seconds).

Common causes:
‚Ä¢ Network congestion (check: https://status.solana.com)
‚Ä¢ Low priority fee
‚Ä¢ RPC endpoint issues

üîß What to do now:
1. Check transaction status:
   solana confirm <signature> --url devnet
2. View on explorer:
   https://explorer.solana.com/tx/<signature>?cluster=devnet
3. If not found after 2 minutes, retry the transaction

üí° Pro tips:
‚Ä¢ Add --priority-fee flag for faster confirmation
‚Ä¢ Use dedicated RPC endpoints during high traffic
‚Ä¢ Monitor network TPS at https://solanabeach.io
`,

  ACCOUNT_FETCH: `
‚è±Ô∏è  Account fetch timeout (10+ seconds).

Possible issues:
‚Ä¢ RPC endpoint is overloaded
‚Ä¢ Network connectivity problems
‚Ä¢ Account doesn't exist on this network

üîß Quick fixes:
1. Check network status: ghostspeak doctor
2. Verify you're on the right network:
   ghostspeak config get network
3. Try direct RPC query:
   solana account <address> --url devnet

üåê Network troubleshooting:
‚Ä¢ Test connection: ping api.devnet.solana.com
‚Ä¢ Switch RPC: ghostspeak config set rpcUrl <new-url>
‚Ä¢ Check firewall/VPN settings
`,

  SDK_INIT: `
‚è±Ô∏è  SDK initialization timeout (5+ seconds).

This suggests:
‚Ä¢ Slow module loading
‚Ä¢ File system issues
‚Ä¢ Node.js performance problems

üîß Troubleshooting steps:
1. Clear module cache:
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
2. Reinstall dependencies:
   bun install --force
3. Check disk space:
   df -h
4. Restart terminal session

‚ö° Performance tips:
‚Ä¢ Use Bun instead of Node.js for 2x faster startup
‚Ä¢ Close other heavy applications
‚Ä¢ Check for antivirus interference
`,

  RPC_CALL: `
‚è±Ô∏è  RPC request timeout (15+ seconds).

Common causes:
‚Ä¢ Public RPC rate limits hit
‚Ä¢ High network latency
‚Ä¢ RPC endpoint maintenance

üîß Immediate actions:
1. Wait 60 seconds (rate limits reset)
2. Check RPC health: ghostspeak doctor
3. Switch to backup RPC:
   ghostspeak config set rpcUrl https://api.devnet.solana.com

üÜì Free RPC alternatives:
‚Ä¢ Helius: https://dev.helius.xyz
‚Ä¢ QuickNode: https://quicknode.com
‚Ä¢ Alchemy: https://alchemy.com
‚Ä¢ Triton: https://triton.one

üí° Set custom timeout:
ghostspeak agent list --timeout 30000
`
} as const;

/**
 * Get a user-friendly message for a timeout error
 */
export function getTimeoutMessage(operation: string, timeoutMs: number): string {
  // Try to find a specific message
  for (const [key, message] of Object.entries(TIMEOUT_MESSAGES)) {
    if (operation.toLowerCase().includes(key.toLowerCase().replace('_', ' '))) {
      return message;
    }
  }

  // Default message
  return `
Operation timed out after ${timeoutMs / 1000} seconds.

This might be due to:
‚Ä¢ Network issues
‚Ä¢ Server unavailability
‚Ä¢ High system load

Please check your connection and try again.
