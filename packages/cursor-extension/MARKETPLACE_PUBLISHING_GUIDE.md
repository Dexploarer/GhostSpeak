## 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP PUBLISHING PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Prerequisites Setup (5 minutes)**

#### **1.1 Install Visual Studio Code Extension CLI**
```bash
# Install the official VS Code extension CLI
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Verify installation
vsce --version
```

#### **1.2 Create Azure DevOps Account**
1. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
2. Sign in with Microsoft account (or create one)
3. Create a new organization (can use any name)
4. You'll use this for marketplace publishing

### **Step 2: Generate Personal Access Token (5 minutes)**

#### **2.1 Create PAT in Azure DevOps**
1. In Azure DevOps, click your profile picture (top right)
2. Select "Personal access tokens"
3. Click "New Token"
4. Configure token:
   - **Name**: "VS Code Marketplace Publishing"
   - **Organization**: Select your organization
   - **Expiration**: 90 days (or custom)
   - **Scopes**: Select "Custom defined"
   - **Marketplace**: Check "Acquire" and "Manage" ✅

#### **2.2 Save Your Token**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Save this token securely!
# You'll only see it once and need it for publishing
# Example: abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
```

### **Step 3: Create Publisher Account (3 minutes)**

#### **3.1 Create Publisher**
```bash
# Create a publisher (one-time setup)
vsce create-publisher your-publisher-name

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Publisher name (e.g., "wija-studio")  
# - Display name (e.g., "Wija Studio")
# - Description
# - Personal Access Token (from Step 2)
```

#### **3.2 Update package.json Publisher**
```json
{
  "publisher": "your-publisher-name",  // ← Update this
  "name": "wija-studio",
  "displayName": "Wija Studio",
  // ... rest of config
}
```

### **Step 4: Build and Package Extension (2 minutes)**

#### **4.1 Compile TypeScript**
```bash
# Navigate to your extension directory
cd packages/cursor-extension

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run compile

# Verify compilation worked
ls out/
```

#### **4.2 Package Extension**
```bash
# Create .vsix package file
vsce package

# This creates: wija-studio-1.0.0.vsix
# File size should be reasonable (< 10MB typically)
```

### **Step 5: Test Extension Locally (2 minutes)**

#### **5.1 Install Locally for Testing**
```bash
# Install the packaged extension locally
code --install-extension wija-studio-1.0.0.vsix

# Test in VS Code:
# 1. Restart VS Code
# 2. Look for Wija Studio in sidebar
# 3. Try a few commands to verify functionality
# 4. Check for any errors in Developer Console
```

### **Step 6: Publish to Marketplace (1 minute)**

#### **6.1 Login with Token**
```bash
# Login to VS Code Marketplace
vsce login your-publisher-name

# Enter your Personal Access Token when prompted
```

#### **6.2 Publish Extension**
```bash
# Publish to marketplace (this is it!)
vsce publish

# Or publish with automatic version increment
vsce publish patch  # 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
vsce publish minor  # 1.0.0 → 1.1.0  
vsce publish major  # 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
```

### **Step 7: Verify Publication (2 minutes)**

#### **7.1 Check Marketplace**
1. Go to [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com)
2. Search for "Wija Studio"
3. Verify your extension appears
4. Check that description, icon, and details look correct

#### **7.2 Test Installation from Marketplace**
```bash
# Test public installation
code --install-extension your-publisher-name.wija-studio

# Or install via VS Code UI:
# Extensions → Search "Wija Studio" → Install
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES**

### **Issue: "Publisher not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Create publisher first
vsce create-publisher your-unique-name
```

### **Issue: "Personal Access Token invalid"**
```bash
# Solution: Check token permissions
# Must have "Marketplace > Acquire" and "Marketplace > Manage"
vsce logout
vsce login your-publisher-name
```

### **Issue: "Package.json validation failed"**
```bash
# Solution: Check required fields
# Ensure you have: name, version, publisher, engines.vscode
```

### **Issue: "Icon file not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Verify icon path
# Check that assets/wija-icon.png exists
# Icon should be 128x128 PNG format
```

### **Issue: "Extension too large"**
```bash
# Solution: Check .vscodeignore file
echo "node_modules/**" >> .vscodeignore
echo "src/**" >> .vscodeignore
echo "tests/**" >> .vscodeignore
echo "docs/**" >> .vscodeignore
```
