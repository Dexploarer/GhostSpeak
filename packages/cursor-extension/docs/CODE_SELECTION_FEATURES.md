# üîÆ Wija Studio - Code Selection Features

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: **COMPLETED & VERIFIED**

The Wija Studio VS Code extension now includes **comprehensive code selection functionality** that allows users to interact with highlighted code in powerful new ways. This is **production-ready code** that has been tested and verified.

## üéØ FEATURE OVERVIEW

When you select/highlight code in VS Code, you now have **4 powerful options** available in the context menu:

1. **Save Selection as Prayer** - Store reusable code patterns
2. **Extract Selection as Variable** - Refactor code intelligently  
3. **Send Selection to AI** - Get AI assistance for code improvement
4. **Analyze Selection** - Get detailed code insights

## üöÄ FEATURE DETAILS

### 1. Save Selection as Prayer

**What it does:**
- Automatically generates a meaningful name for the code snippet
- Detects the appropriate category (Functions, Classes, Logic, etc.)
- Auto-tags the code with relevant labels
- Preserves context (file path, line numbers)
- Stores the code for future reuse

**How to use:**
1. Select code in any supported language
2. Right-click ‚Üí "Save Selection as Prayer"
3. The code is automatically saved with smart categorization

**Example:**
```typescript
// Select this code:
async function fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<User> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
  return response.json();
}

// Automatically becomes a prayer named "fetchUserData" 
// with category "Functions" and tags: ["typescript", "async", "api"]
```

### 2. Extract Selection as Variable

**What it does:**
- Analyzes the selected code to suggest variable name and type
- Generates language-specific variable declarations
- Inserts the variable declaration before the selected code
- Replaces the original code with a variable reference
- Supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, Python, and more

**How to use:**
1. Select code you want to extract
2. Right-click ‚Üí "Extract Selection as Variable"
3. Review/edit the suggested variable name
4. The code is automatically refactored

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before:
const userData = await fetch('/api/users/123').then(r => r.json());

// After extraction:
const apiResponse = await fetch('/api/users/123').then(r => r.json());
const userData = apiResponse;
```

### 3. Send Selection to AI

**What it does:**
- Builds context-aware prompts for AI analysis
- Includes code language, file path, and line numbers
- Allows you to review and edit the prompt before sending
- Sends to your configured AI provider (OpenAI, Groq, etc.)
- Shows AI response in a formatted webview
- Optionally saves the interaction as a prayer

**How to use:**
1. Select code you want AI to analyze
2. Right-click ‚Üí "Send Selection to AI"
3. Review/edit the generated prompt
4. Get AI feedback and suggestions
5. Optionally save the interaction for future use

**Example AI Prompt Generated:**
```
I have the following code that I want to improve or understand better:

Language: typescript
File: /src/services/userService.ts
Lines: 15-25

Code:
async function fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<User> {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
  return response.json();
}

Please help me by:
1. Explaining what this code does
2. Suggesting improvements
3. Providing alternative approaches if applicable
4. Pointing out any potential issues or best practices
```

### 4. Analyze Selection

**What it does:**
- Performs comprehensive code analysis
- Detects programming patterns (async/await, promises, etc.)
- Assesses code complexity
- Identifies purpose and functionality
- Generates detailed analysis reports
- Shows results in a formatted webview

**How to use:**
1. Select code you want to analyze
2. Right-click ‚Üí "Analyze Selection"
3. View comprehensive analysis report

**Example Analysis Report:**
```
