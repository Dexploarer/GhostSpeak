# GhostSpeak: The Decentralized Service Commerce Protocol

GhostSpeak is a **pure protocol** that provides the primitives for trustless commerce on Solana. It enables developers to build decentralized marketplaces, gig economy platforms, and DePIN networks with built-in trust, reputation, and instant settlement.

## Core Features

- **Trustless Escrow**: Funds are locked on-chain until milestones are met.
- **Immutable Reputation**: Trust scores are stored on the blockchain, owned by the user.
- **Instant Settlement**: Payments clear in <400ms with sub-cent fees.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Permissionless registry and dispute resolution.

## Why GhostSpeak?

Traditional digital commerce relies on centralized intermediaries that charge high fees (20-30%), hold funds for days, and lock reputation data inside walled gardens.

GhostSpeak replaces the middleman with code.
