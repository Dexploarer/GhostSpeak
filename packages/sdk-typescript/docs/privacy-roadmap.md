# GhostSpeak Privacy Features Roadmap

## Current Status (July 2025)

The Solana ZK ElGamal Proof Program is temporarily disabled on mainnet due to security vulnerabilities discovered in 2025. This affects our ability to provide full zero-knowledge proof-based confidential transfers. We've implemented a hybrid approach to deliver privacy features today while preparing for the full ZK integration.

## Privacy Features Timeline

### Phase 1: Client-Side Encryption (Available Now) ✅

**Status**: Implemented and available in beta

**Features**:
- Client-side ElGamal encryption of sensitive amounts
- Encrypted metadata storage via IPFS
- Local proof generation (not verified on-chain)
- Privacy-preserving work orders

**Limitations**:
- No on-chain proof verification
- Requires trust in client implementations
- Not suitable for fully trustless applications

**Use Cases**:
- Private work order details
- Confidential agent communications
- Encrypted service descriptions
- Private reputation data

### Phase 2: Hybrid Privacy Mode (Current) 🚧

**Status**: In active development

**Features**:
- Dual-mode transaction builders
- Automatic fallback between ZK and client encryption
- Feature flags for easy transition
- Monitoring for ZK program re-enablement

**Benefits**:
- Same API for both privacy modes
- Seamless transition when ZK proofs available
- No breaking changes for developers

### Phase 3: Full ZK Proof Integration (Coming Soon) 🔜

**Status**: Awaiting Solana ZK ElGamal Proof Program re-enablement

**Timeline**: Expected within 2-4 months (pending security audit completion)

**Features**:
- On-chain zero-knowledge proof verification
- Fully trustless confidential transfers
- Private token balances with Token-2022
- Batched proof verification for efficiency

**Benefits**:
- No trust assumptions
- Maximum privacy guarantees
- Native Solana performance
- Industry-standard cryptography

## Current Implementation Details

### Client-Side Encryption

```typescript
// Current approach for private transactions
import { ClientEncryption } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'

const encryption = new ClientEncryption()
const encrypted = await encryption.encryptAmount(amount, recipientPubkey)
const ipfsHash = await encryption.storeMetadata(encrypted)
```

### Feature Detection

```typescript
import { getPrivacyStatus } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'

const status = getPrivacyStatus()
console.log(status)
// {
//   mode: 'client-encryption',
//   beta: true,
//   message: 'Confidential transfers using client-side encryption (Beta - ZK proofs coming soon)'
// }
```

### Migration Path

When ZK proofs become available:

1. **Automatic Detection**: SDK will detect ZK program availability
2. **Seamless Switch**: Same API continues to work
3. **Performance Boost**: On-chain verification replaces client-side
4. **No Code Changes**: Existing implementations continue working

## Privacy Feature Comparison

| Feature | Client Encryption (Now) | ZK Proofs (Future) |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Amount Privacy | ✅ Encrypted locally | ✅ Encrypted on-chain |
| Balance Privacy | ⚠️ Visible on-chain | ✅ Hidden on-chain |
| Proof Verification | ❌ Client-side only | ✅ On-chain verification |
| Trust Model | Trust in clients | Trustless |
| Performance | Fast (local) | Fast (native) |
| Storage | IPFS + on-chain hash | Fully on-chain |

## Best Practices for Developers

### 1. Use Feature Flags

```typescript
import { isFeatureEnabled } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'

if (isFeatureEnabled('CONFIDENTIAL_TRANSFERS_ENABLED')) {
  // Use privacy features
}
```

### 2. Prepare for Migration

```typescript
// Use abstracted interfaces
const result = await client.confidentialTransfer({
  amount,
  recipient,
  // SDK handles encryption method internally
})
```

### 3. Handle Beta Status

```typescript
const privacyStatus = getPrivacyStatus()
if (privacyStatus.beta) {
  console.warn('Privacy features are in beta:', privacyStatus.message)
}
```

## Monitoring ZK Program Status

The SDK includes automatic monitoring for the ZK ElGamal Proof Program:

```typescript
import { monitorZkProgramStatus } from '@ghostspeak/sdk'

const stopMonitoring = monitorZkProgramStatus((status) => {
  if (status.enabled) {
    console.log('ZK proofs are now available!')
    // SDK will automatically switch to ZK mode
  }
})
```

## Security Considerations

### Current (Client Encryption)
- Validate encryption on client
- Verify IPFS content hashes
- Use secure key management
- Audit client implementations

### Future (ZK Proofs)
- Automatic on-chain verification
- No trust assumptions needed
- Cryptographically secure
- Audited by Solana team

## FAQ

**Q: Why are ZK proofs disabled?**
A: Security vulnerabilities were discovered in April/June 2025. Solana teams are conducting security audits.

**Q: When will ZK proofs be available?**
A: Expected within 2-4 months, pending audit completion.

**Q: Should I wait for ZK proofs?**
A: No, use client encryption now. The migration will be seamless.

**Q: Will my code break when ZK proofs are enabled?**
A: No, the SDK handles the transition automatically.

**Q: How can I test ZK proofs today?**
A: Use a local validator with the ZK program enabled.
