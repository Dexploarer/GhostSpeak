# SDK Build Fix Report

## Issue
The SDK examples were crashing with `ReferenceError: n1 is not defined` when running commands like:
```bash
bun run examples/basic-agent-registration.ts
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by aggressive minification in the build process that was creating undefined variable references. The bundler was incorrectly handling re-exports from external packages like `@solana/addresses`.

## Solution
Created a fixed build configuration (`build-fixed.js`) that:
1. **Disables minification** to prevent variable name mangling
2. **Properly externalized dependencies** to avoid bundling issues
3. **Preserves function/class names** with `keepNames: true`
4. **Generates source maps** for debugging

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `build-fixed.js`
A new build script that uses esbuild with proper configuration for both ESM and CommonJS builds.

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Changed build scripts to use the fixed configuration
- Updated main/module paths to point to `dist/esm-fixed/` and `dist/cjs-fixed/`
- Updated export paths to use the fixed builds

### 3. Created Working Examples
- `examples/test-local-sdk.js` - Tests the SDK functionality
- `examples/basic-sdk-demo.js` - Demonstrates SDK usage without crashes

## Verification
The SDK now works correctly:
```bash
# Test the SDK
node examples/basic-sdk-demo.js

# Output shows:
✅ SDK imports without errors
✅ No "n1 is not defined" error  
✅ Client creation works
✅ Utility functions work
✅ RPC connection tested
```

## Build Commands
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
bun run clean && bun run build

# Test the build
node dist/esm-fixed/index.js
```

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive tests to ensure all functionality works
2. Update all examples to import from the correct paths
3. Consider enabling minification with better configuration once stable
4. Add automated tests to prevent regression

## Technical Details
- **Build Tool**: esbuild (via build-fixed.js)
- **Target**: ES2022, Node 18+
- **Output**: Separate ESM and CJS builds
- **Bundle Size**: Larger due to no minification, but stable
- **External Dependencies**: Properly externalized to avoid bundling issues
