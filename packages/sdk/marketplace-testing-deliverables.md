## üêõ Bugs Found and Fixed

### Critical Bug Fixed: RPC Connection Pool Error
**Issue**: CircularBuffer missing `length` property and `reduce` method
```javascript
TypeError: this.responseTimes.reduce is not a function
```
**Root Cause**: Custom CircularBuffer class didn't implement Array-compatible interface
**Fix Applied**: Added `length` getter and `reduce` method to CircularBuffer class
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Tests now pass without RPC errors

### Issues Identified for Future Resolution
1. **Web3.js v2 API Migration**: Some client methods need v2 API updates
2. **Smart Contract Extensions**: Cancel listing functionality needs new instruction
3. **Rate Limiting**: Improve network request throttling and retry logic
