```javascript
TypeError: this.responseTimes.reduce is not a function
```
**Impact:** Network requests failing intermittently
**Priority:** HIGH

### 2. Web3.js v2 API Integration Gaps
**Problem:** Some client methods using incorrect API calls
```javascript
error: this.rpc.getBalance(address, { commitment: this.commitment }).send is not a function
```
**Impact:** Balance checking and cluster info failing
**Priority:** HIGH

### 3. Transaction Factory Implementation
**Problem:** Transaction builder not properly configured for all instruction types
**Impact:** Some advanced features cannot execute transactions
**Priority:** MEDIUM

### 4. Missing Smart Contract Features
**Problem:** Some marketplace operations (e.g., `cancelListing`) not implemented in smart contract
```typescript
// This would need a new instruction in the smart contract
throw new Error('Cancel listing functionality requires smart contract update')
```
**Impact:** Limited marketplace management capabilities
**Priority:** MEDIUM

## Performance Analysis

### Bundle Size and Efficiency
- ✅ **Tree-shakeable Design**: Proper ES modules with dynamic imports
- ✅ **Minimal Dependencies**: Using Web3.js v2 modular approach
