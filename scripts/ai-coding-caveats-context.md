# AI-Generated Code Verification Context for GhostSpeak Protocol

## 🗓️ Current Development Context (July 2025)

**CRITICAL**: All verification must understand this is July 2025, not past years.

## 🔬 Cutting-Edge Technology Stack (July 2025)

### Solana Ecosystem - Latest Patterns:
- **@solana/kit** (Web3.js v2+) - NOT legacy @solana/web3.js v1
- **Anchor 0.31.1+** with 2025 security enhancements
- **SPL Token-2022** with confidential transfers, transfer fees
- **Solana 2.1.0 (Agave)** client with latest features
- **ZK Compression** for 5000x cost reduction on NFTs
- **Latest RPC patterns** with TypedRpcClient interfaces

### Deprecated/Outdated Patterns to Flag:
```typescript
// ❌ OLD - Flag as outdated AI generation
import { Connection, PublicKey, Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js'
import { Token } from '@solana/spl-token'

// ✅ CURRENT - July 2025 patterns
import { Address, address } from '@solana/addresses'
import { TransactionSigner, createSolanaRpc } from '@solana/kit'
import { TokenProgram } from '@solana/spl-token-2022'
```

## 🚨 AI-Generated Code Caveats for GhostSpeak

### 1. Hallucinated APIs and Functions
**Common AI Mistakes:**
- Inventing non-existent Solana RPC methods
- Creating fake @solana/kit functions
- Mixing Token and Token-2022 program methods incorrectly
- Using deprecated Anchor constraint patterns

**Verification Points:**
- Verify ALL imported functions actually exist in July 2025
- Check API method signatures match current documentation
- Ensure Token-2022 extensions are properly initialized
- Validate PDA derivation matches current Anchor patterns

### 2. Outdated Pattern Usage
**Common AI Problems:**
- Using old web3.js Connection patterns instead of @solana/kit RPC
- Legacy Token program instead of Token-2022
- Old Anchor constraint syntax
- Deprecated error handling patterns

**Verification Points:**
- Flag any @solana/web3.js v1 imports as CRITICAL errors
- Ensure all token operations use Token-2022 when appropriate
- Verify Anchor constraints follow 0.31.1+ patterns
- Check error types match current GhostSpeakError enum

### 3. Security Anti-Patterns
**AI Often Generates:**
- Insufficient input validation
- Missing PDA bump validation
- Inadequate rate limiting
- Exposed private keys in logs/errors
- Missing admin authorization checks

**Verification Points:**
- All user inputs must have validation
- PDA derivations must use canonical patterns
- Rate limiting required on public instructions
- No secrets in error messages or logs
- Admin operations must use require_admin! macro

### 4. Performance Issues
**AI Commonly Creates:**
- Inefficient account lookups
- Unnecessary memory allocations
- Missing instruction batching
- Redundant PDA derivations
- Large transaction sizes

**Verification Points:**
- Account lookups should be optimized
- Memory allocation should be minimal
- Instructions should support batching where possible
- PDA derivations should be cached when possible
- Transaction size should be optimized

### 5. Type Safety Violations
**AI Frequently Does:**
- Uses `any` types unnecessarily
- Missing null/undefined checks
- Incorrect bigint/number conversions
- Wrong Address vs string usage
- Missing optional property handling

**Verification Points:**
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- All inputs checked for null/undefined
- Proper bigint usage for token amounts
- Address types used consistently
- Optional properties handled safely

### 6. Integration Issues
**AI Often Misses:**
- Incorrect program ID references
- Wrong network-specific addresses
- Missing environment variable usage
- Hardcoded values that should be configurable
- Cross-instruction state consistency

**Verification Points:**
- Program ID must match current deployment: F3qAjuzkNTbDL6wtZv4wGyHUi66j7uM2uRCDXWJ3Bg87
- Network detection should be dynamic
- No hardcoded addresses except constants
- Environment variables properly utilized
- State changes must be atomic

## 🧠 GhostSpeak-Specific AI Caveats

### ElGamal Cryptography
**AI Often Generates:**
- Fake cryptographic functions
- Incorrect curve implementations
- Mock proof generation
- Wrong key formats

**Verification Points:**
- All crypto functions must use @noble/curves
- ElGamal implementations must match bulletproof spec
- Proof generation must integrate with Solana's ZK proof program
- Key formats must be consistent with ed25519

### Multisig Integration
**AI Commonly Creates:**
- Simplified multisig that lacks features
- Missing transaction proposal flow
- Incorrect signature verification
- Missing approval thresholds

**Verification Points:**
- Multisig must support variable thresholds
- Transaction proposals must be persistent
- Signature verification must be cryptographically sound
- Approval flow must handle partial signatures

### Token-2022 Extensions
**AI Frequently Misses:**
- Extension initialization order
- Transfer fee calculations
- Confidential transfer setup
- Extension account sizing

**Verification Points:**
- Extensions must be initialized atomically with mint
- Transfer fees must be calculated correctly
- Confidential transfers need proper proof handling
- Account space must include extension data
